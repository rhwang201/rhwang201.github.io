My name is Richard Hwang, and I currently work as a Software Engineer at
[C3 Energy](https://www.c3energy.com). I graduated from [UC
Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu) with a degree in Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science in May 2014.

I enjoy playing guitar, weightlifting, reading (history, science, fiction),
cooking, and making things (like this blog!).

My name is Richard Hwang, and I currently work as a Software Engineer at
[C3 IOT](https://www.c3iot.com). I graduated from [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu)
with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in May 2014.

I enjoy playing guitar, weightlifting, backpacking. I am just getting into volleyball,
salsa, photography, and sewing.

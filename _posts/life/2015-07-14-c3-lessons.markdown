Today, I celebrate (not literally, I actually forgot) my one year anniversary as
a software engineer at C3 Energy, my first full-time position. Coincidentally, today is
also the last day for the guy who was a major factor in my joining and who I was probably
closest to at C3. Here are some lessons I learned from him.

* Don't complain. (sometimes...if you do, it should always be constructive)
* Communicate more effectively. If you think you're doing a good job, do an even better
  job.
* The intangibles matter. People matter. Be nice to others, help others out.

Good luck man. The list seems short, but the value is immense

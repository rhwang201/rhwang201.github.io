Competitive exercise, specifically weight lifting, has been a defining part of
my life. As I am sure many others attest to, lifting has altered me not just
physiologically but also mentally.

I used to be a not-too-uncommon fat youth, consuming far too chicken nuggets,
sweet sugar-laced drinks, and potato chips, spending far too much time on
the couch in front of the television, afraid to pursue any physical activities
out of laziness, fear of inadequacy, and the knowledge that that shit is damn
uncomfortable. It is actually quite amazing I was able to be snapped out of
that state. I really must thank my sister for that, as she slowly influenced
my eating habits and encouraged me to exercise. My physical state has gone
a long ways since then. It is quite remarkable to look back on the first
initial changes, such as my sister telling me to eat one or two less handfuls
of grapes, or running one lap at the track, and see how they have snowballed
into where I stand now.

Through all that, I suppose I have learned a few things.

Discipline, one of my defining characteristics, was developed through lifting.
You can have a shitty day or even a string of shitty days. You can have an
amazing day and blow yourself away. Neither means anything in of itself. You
must consistenly apply yourself, and this requires discipline. Discipline to
understand on session by itself means nothing. Discipline to stick to a plan,
over a long period of time, and understand the plan will get you to your goal.

In fact, lifting has highlighted the importance of having a goal.

Lifting has just plainly made me tougher.

To lift any respectable weights, one must become humble.

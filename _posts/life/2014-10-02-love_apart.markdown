You can love someone even if you are no longer together with her.

Even though you no longer get to hear how her day was. Even though you no
longer get to make her breakfast. Even though you both wake up in separate beds
and the first thing you see now is just an unused pillow.

A relationship may not work out. Maybe you weren't ready for her. Maybe you
were always too different. Maybe you gave up too easily. But that doesn't mean
you stop loving her.

It doesn't mean you don't think of her often. It doesn't mean you don't wonder
how she's doing, if she's taking care of herself, if she's still laughing. Her
memory floats up, and you think, how is she doing, I really wish everything in
her life is perfect, I wish was still there for her.

You can love someone even if you are not together. It makes a sad and painful
tale.

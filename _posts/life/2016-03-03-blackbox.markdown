The less of a blackbox something is, the easier it is to dig in and debug.

It's such an obvious statement. Blackboxing is supremely useful for building large
systems with modularity. It is helpful to know a bit about everything though. If you
treat something as a pure blackbox and it breaks down, what can you do but feed it inputs
and look at the outputs? Knowing some, _any_, details about the guts can help you. If
you've run your fingers along the oil chamber and felt the nuts that secure it, you'll be
less afraid when it actually comes time to change the oil. If you understand how RDDs are
implemented despite having never looked at the source code, at least you can stumble
along like an educated drunkard.

When breaking down tasks and working on a large project, yes blackbox things for the sake
of productivity. But don't be afraid to breakdown those walls. Let your curiosity take
the wheel. You'll be surprise when it helps you out later down the road.

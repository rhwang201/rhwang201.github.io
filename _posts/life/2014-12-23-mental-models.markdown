I recently read a Paul Graham article,
[How You Know](http://www.paulgraham.com/know.html), that stirred up the
introspective cogs in my brain. It reminds me of what a friend of mine once
talked to me about at 3AM, the end of a fun night.

Personality and one's mental model of the world are very intertwined. I have
always believed in the importance of mindset in influencing one's life (re:
Napolean Hill's Think and Grow Rich). In fact, the whole
iron-will-never-give-up thing has been a pretty central part of my life and
shaping who I am now. I suppose it's only now that I am realizing and
acknowledging how many different world views there are, how many different
interpretations of the same objective scene or event. ...what's that silly
quote.

> Your beliefs become your thoughts, 
> Your thoughts become your words, 
> Your words become your actions, 
> Your actions become your habits, 
> Your habits become your values, 
> Your values become your destiny

I believed this quote on a surface level when I first read it, as one does with
any quote. Now, I have actually synthesized it a bit with my world view,
through livin a bit more of life.

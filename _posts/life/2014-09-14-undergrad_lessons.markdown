I gave the professional development rush presentation for Theta Tau recently.
It was a good opportunity for me to reflect on my college experiences, what
I gained and what I should have done better. Here are the points I made:

* Don't be afraid of asking questions or seeming dumb.
* Admit your weaknesses.
* Embrace the negative feedback cycle.
* Learn to plan.
* Your time is limited. Have a vision.
* Make every choice deliberate.
* Prepare for interviews.
* Do not worry excessively about grades...
* or money. 
* Soft skills matter.
* Have a wide range of interests.
* Don't forget to have a good time.
* Do what you say you will do.

I think the speech went well. I have definitely improved a lot as a speaker.
Not having a crowd of 100+ also helped my nerves a bunch. I have embraced
pauses in my speech that really allow me to collect my thoughts and speak more
slowly.

Some other thoughts I didn't include in the talk:

* I wish I valued relationships more.
* I wish I learned a balance between discipline and flexibility.

It was a good talk. Look for other opportunities to talk. Spend a bit more time
preparing so that the flow of the talk makes more sense. Practice injecting
humor more smoothly. I think your personality has potential to really inspire
people, develop that.

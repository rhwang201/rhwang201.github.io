I was talking today, and I thought about money. I've always thought I already have more
money than I need to be comfortable and happy. Maybe I should quantify a bit.

# Basics
* I enjoy living in the city. It seems like at most I will pay $1900 for somewhere
  I truly enjoy living.
* I cook a lot, and don't like eating out by nature. And even when I do eat out, I love
  eating the cheap, local stuff.

# Entertainment
* I like outdoors things, but also DIY and doing it cheap.
* I want motorcycles and cars (although the car will be super cheap).
* I like clothes, although I buy some things used. Pants, shoes will be new.
* Salsa is like $20 a week.

# Saving

# TODO
At the end of August, calculate how much you spent. Assume that is how much you need to
live comfortably. Calculate when you can retire.

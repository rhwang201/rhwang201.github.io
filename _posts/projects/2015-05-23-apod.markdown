Sometimes, when you take two things you love and mash them together, it turns into
something even more awesome.

[Astronomy Picture of the Day](http://apod.nasa.gov) is a website that has been running
since 1995. Two former NASA scientists curate pictures related to astronomical phenomena
and post a new picture every day along with an easy to read description. Starting with
fourteen visitors, APOD (as it is affectionately known) now has a wide fanbase across the
world.

For as long as I've used computers, I've been a sucker for filling screens with beautiful
imagery. Only an insane person would have an ugly desktop background; you see that image
tens of times a day, how could you let it be an eyesore! That also applies to web
browsers, especially as computer users now spend most of their time surfing the web.
We open new tabs constantly.  Why not make that new tab screen enjoyable?

APOD New Tab helps me meet my daily recommended value for informative astronomy pictures,
while satisfying my never-ending craving for jaw-dropping pictures. Building it was
simple and fun. The new tab is just displaying a webpage, afterall, so I only needed
my basic knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript. To make my life even easier, NASA has a super
simple APOD API.

I really enjoyed setting personal deadlines/goals and shipping this to the Chrome
Webstore, even when I was a bit uncomfortable. It is fun to play with design and iterate
on the product. Even though there are already several extensions that accomplish the same
thing, I'm glad I made my own (and I even think it's better than the rest ;) ).

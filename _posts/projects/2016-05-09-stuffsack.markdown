![Stuff Sack]({{site.url}}/images/projects/stuffsack.jpg "Stuff Sack")

I just finished my first sewing project! I've had a love for backpacking for the past
year or so. Gear is an important part of exploring the backcountry. I have been hoping to
get into ultralight backpacking, and I have seen that many ultralighters are also
DIY-ers. I finally finished my first project.

I grabbed an old Singer sewing machine from Craigslist. Seems like most sewing machines
last forever; mine is all metal. I found instructions online for sewing a stuffsack,
seemingly the easiest project possible, and thus the best introductory project with the
least potential for me blowing up my apartment. I ordered silnylon from eBay, picked up
100% polyester thread and a #10 needle from my local fabric store, and grabbed cord and
cord locks from outdoors stores. Then, I began sewing!

Sewing...really wasn't that bad after a bit of practice. Silnylon definitely did not make
my first experience any easier. It slips very easily, so when I was trying to sew two
edges together, the top and bottom edges would occasionally slip. Still, I was able to
create a functioning stuff sack. Some lessons learned:

* Keep tension on the silnylon as you guide it.
* Easy on the gas.
* Backstitch.
* How to set up the sewing machine (sans bobbin thread, which I will have to learn
  eventually)

I'm excited to take my new stuffsack on a trip! It may break, but hey, shouldn't be too
hard to replace.

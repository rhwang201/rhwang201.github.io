Squat       :   195x5x3

Press       :   115x5x3

Dip         :   35x5x5

Facepull    :   70x15x5

### Notes

Sleeping and eating a bit less recently. Squat was okay. Need to brace the abs a lot and
stick ass back. Always gets better during later sets. Really, brace your core.

Press is okay, a little lopsided and hard. 5lb jumps now.

Dips were easy, hard to gauge depth.

Facepulls were whatever.

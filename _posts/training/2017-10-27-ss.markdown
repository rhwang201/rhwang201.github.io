### Notes

Okay. Deep sleep, because of deficit probably haha. Lower back still not great on squats.
Not staying tight in hole, need to keep weight a bit more back, lean over more, and keep
back tight.

Bench whatever, elbows still mildly irritated. Did explosive close-grip at the end of
workout.

Chins good, did bodyweight for additional pump.

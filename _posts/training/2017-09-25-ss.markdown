### Notes

Decent day. Took a nighttime cold medicine yesterday, and ptfo'd. Squats getting heavy
again! Neutral neck, stay tight, continue doing external rotator stretch, neutral hip.

Bench was good! Remember to squeeze the bar. Set up with good shoulder position; down and
back. That'll make it easier to hit a good bottom position.

Back still not feeling great on deads. Need to keep back and neck in line on working
sets, just like warmups. Set the entire back, with the lats.

Lateral raises good.

Overhead, side band stretch, external rotator.

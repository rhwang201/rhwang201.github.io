Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   205x5x5

Chinup      :   40x5x4,4

### Notes

Lifted at World's Gym in SF with Deng and Mike. Squat was whatever, was in Deng's oly
shoes. Keep back upright...

Bench was good! Hard, but pushed through.

Chins were also good, but couldn't get last rep, despite giving it a good fight.

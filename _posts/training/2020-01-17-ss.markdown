Squat       :   195x5x3

Bench       :   185x4x4

Deadlift    :   265x5

Chinup      :   35x7,5,4

Skullcrusher    :   40x10x3

### Notes

Squats were a bit off to start, maybe biking got body in a weird state. Weight wasn't
centered over midfoot. Got better on last set after you gripped the floor.

Bench was meh. Messed up last warmup (it was heavier than working set), also wasn't
feeling strong/confident.

Deads alright, grip is a bit weak.

Squat       :   165x5x5

Press       :   125x5x3

### Notes

Squat is better (?). Used the breathing cue (breath into your lower back) as
well as setting pelvis/trunk before each rep. Seems to help _a lot_. Also on
midfoot a lot more. Still seems a bit asymmetric.

Light pressing day, but I definitely felt fatigued from benching. Got
everything though.

Squat, overhead, hip flexor, glute bridges.

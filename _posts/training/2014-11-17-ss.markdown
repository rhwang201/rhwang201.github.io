Squat       :   225x5x3

Bench       :   187.5x5x3

Chinup      :   30x7,7,5

### Notes

Overall, shitty day.

Squats were okay...They felt tiring but looked decent. Be careful of going too
deep, sit back more, ass straight up. Biggest thing is YOUR FUCKING RACK IS
WRONG AGAIN. Learn to keep all the weight on your back before handling any
significant weight.

Considering the bad rack, bench wasn't terrible. Got all the reps. Maybe some
were uneven, but in general stayed tight through sticking points.

Didn't power clean because of cut on leg from Joshua Tree. Might just not pull
all week...

Chinups were pretty good, I guess.

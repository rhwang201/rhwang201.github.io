Squat:          175x5x3

Bench:          135x5x3

Power Clean:    115x3x5

### Notes

Need to sit back more and lean over on squat. Bench is annoying because rack
height is a bit too high; also the sun can get in your eyes. Will probably need
lift-offs eventually. Also bench was pretty uneven; left arm was often lagging.
Might be a result of bad setup. Power clean was rushed. Remember to take your
time setting up and to look up and further away.

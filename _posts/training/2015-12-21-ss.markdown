### Notes

Back at it! For a day. Coming back from illness, but not too bad. Squat was actually
pretty good after I started keeping the weight more towards my heel. Tight in the hole,
smooth bounce. Kept rest time short, felt good.

Press was okay, lockout is weak and I was avoiding fully locking out.

Deadlift sucks, I need to take it slow. Meant to do as many reps as possible. Did two
reps double overhand, grip was dead (expected).

Chinups killed grip. Good job pushing when tired though on last set.

Quick closer-grip bench with no grip.

Squat       :   205x5x3

Press       :   145x2

Deadlift    :   295x5

### Notes

Shitty workout. Came in unfocused, no drive. Was willing to go light on squats, but they
still sucked. Bad rack, back not tight, loose in the hole. Aggravated left lower back.

Press was strong. If I was pumped, could've gotten three.

Deads were okay. Weight definitely forward of midfoot.

Only hip external rotator mobility, was frustrated.

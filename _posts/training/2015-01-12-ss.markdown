Squat       :   230x5x3

Bench       :   185x5x3

Chinup      :   30x7,7,5

### Notes

Squats weren't bad, but they weren't easy. Low bar positioning better but not
there; the second set, I really felt them on top of the rear delts. Better at
sitting down into the hole, still need to be a bit more strict at the bottom.

Bench was pretty good. Shoulders are a bit iffy, but pretty easy over all.

Chins not bad.

Need to get strict form back, maybe start visualizing more during free time.

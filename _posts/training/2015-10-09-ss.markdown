Squat       :   230x5x3

Bench       :   215x2

Chinup      :   0x9x3

### Notes

Okay workout. Legs and torso very sore from lots of sprinting in soccer yesterday. Felt
better after warmups though, managed to pull off squats! Thinking about setting the lower
back really helps maintain lumbar/pelvic position. A bit good morning-ing though, so need
to keep upper back and lats tighter.

Unfortunately, squat rack was not good, so right elbow/shoulder discomfort. Bench was
unremarkable, spotter helped a bit...

Chins seem boring, but I pushed through hard on last set. Good to demonstrate capacity
for grit once again.

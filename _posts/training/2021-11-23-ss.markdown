Snatch :   105x3x3

Push press  : 145x2x5

Front squat   :   210x3x3

Dip      :   80x5,5,4

### Notes

Snatch alright, height is good obviously, just receiving above parallel then squatting down. Pull under fast, and internally rotate shoulders. Can progress cautiously. Strengthen that over head position/get comfortable getting into it quickly

Push press fine, really need to focus on the drive

Front squat hard, not the best back angle...Could progress or improve form

Dips hard

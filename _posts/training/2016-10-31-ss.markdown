Squat       :   215x5x3

Bench       :   215x3,2,3;185x7

Deadlift    :   355x5

Chinup      :   45x5x3,4x1

### Notes

Not a bad day, despite lackluster weekend recovery as usual. Squats were actually good!
Focus on setting "closed" position prior to each rep, and sat into hole nicely. Soliddd

Bench was eh. Combination of not being super tight and a bad liftoff on the second set.

Went "light" on deads, they were pretty good.

Chins felt strong.

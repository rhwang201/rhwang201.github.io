Squat       :   220x5x3

Bench       :   215x3

Deadlift    :   315x5

Chinup      :   90x1

### Notes

Squat strength and form were good, except rack. God damn it Rich, get that right. Gonna
try non-box squats Monday.

Left elbow was irritated for bench. Still got a pretty easy triple though.

Deloaded deads, as I think my form Monday was shit. It will be good to rest it for a bit.

First time maxing out chinups! Started at 55 and surprised myself going up to 90.
Definitely had 95, possibly 100. I think my strength at the bottom is very good.

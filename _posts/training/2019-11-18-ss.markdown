Squat       :   215x5x3

Bench       :   185x5x3

Deadlift    :   305x5

Chinup      :   55x5,5,4,3

### Notes

Meh day, not very strong, also probably woke up in middle of sleep cycle. Squats still
not great, keep it light. Think about three points of contact on foot.

Bench alright, probably uneven left/right.

Deads easy, thinking about foot contact.

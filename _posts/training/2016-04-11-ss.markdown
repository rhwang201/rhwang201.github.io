Squat       :   195x5x3;165x7

Press       :   130x5x4,4x1,1x1;105x7

Chinup      :   45x5x3,4x1;25x5

### Notes

Gnarly turf burn. Sad and motivated, so pushed pretty hard at some points. Squat pelvis
isn't write. Feels like lumbar's being "compressed" in hole. That likely means its
moving. Need to lock it down.

Press was pretty good, kept trunk rigid at points.

Chins were actually pretty good as well.

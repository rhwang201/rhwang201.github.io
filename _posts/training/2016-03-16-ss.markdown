Squat       :   185x5x3

Bench       :   155x5x3

Back Extension  :   45x15x5

Facepull    :   45x15x5

### Notes

Had some coffee and was pretty well rested. Decent workout. Squat rack is much improved,
staying much tighter. Hamstring still a bit hurt, lower back hurts a bit from Monday.
I don't think I aggravated it today.

Bench was easy. Used thin bar, so much grip.

Back extensions good.

Got good rear delt pump from facepulls.

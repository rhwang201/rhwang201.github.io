Power snatch :   105x3x3

Push Press   :   125x3x3

Squat   :   200x5x3

Dip     :   70x5x3

### Notes

Snatch form felt a lot better. Less of a bang, more up, racking in a better spot (sometimes too far back). Okay to progress. Chest up, lock out elbows initially

No benches. Push press alright, still mostly getting used to form.

Squats not bad after warmup (still having a bit of right knee issues). Might've tweaked lower back a little. "Show your taint". Last couple reps good morning'd. One more time

Rushed dips, but got them. Stay tight the entire time/take them seriously, it's heavy now. Okay to progress

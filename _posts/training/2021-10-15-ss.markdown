Snatch :   100x3x3

Push press  : 130x3x3

Front squat   :   195x3x3

Dip      :   70x5x3

### Notes

Snatch harder today, w/o shoes and chalk. Still got it though, but definitely receiving above parallel

Push press pretty good still. Technique must be much improved, since it feels relatively easy. Can progress

Front squats pretty hard, slow it down

Curls too, for the gurls

Squat       :   195x5x3

Bench       :   215x2x5

Deadlift    :   405x1x2

Chinup      :   90x1x2;100x1x2;110x1

### Notes

Not a bad day, had coffee. Pause squats. Lower back not the greatest. Decent job sitting
back though.

Bench was good! Could've done more with spotter. Left bicep though gets a tiny strained.

Deads were hard. Definitely going forward a bit, and not fully loading posterior chain at
the bottom.

Chins were strong. Final part of ROM a bit limited on last rep, but I guess that's fine.

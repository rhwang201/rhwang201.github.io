Squat       :   210x5x3

Bench       :   195x5x2,4;155x10

Deadlift    :   365x5;275x7

Chinup      :   20x7,5

### Notes

Only slept around 6 hours last night. Squat was still pretty good, definitely slower now
though.

Missed last rep on bench because I didn't have a spotter.

Deads were shit, got distracted.

### Notes

Not a bad day. Knee is still tender, so just did a couple squats for fun.

Press was good! A lot better than two weeks ago. Core is tight. First set was super easy.
Remember to stay even when it gets tough.

Dips were okay, got a little distracted by a person working out really close to me at
first. Stabilize before beginning the movement.

Lateral raises fun, I guess. Your elbows can be ent.

Curls good, dece pump.

Ab wheel is challenging/fun.

Got the heart rate up on the bike.

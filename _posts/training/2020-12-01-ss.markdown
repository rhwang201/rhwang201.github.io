Power clean :   155x3x5

Press   :   110x5,5,4

Squat   :   195x5x3

Chinup  :   35x5x3

### Notes

Cleans not bad, decent height and rack, though can probably have stronger positional strength staying over the bar. Progress slowly.

Press not bad, ribs still a little injured but can't feel much during a set.

Squats so-so, repeat the weight. Stay tighter.

Chins easy.

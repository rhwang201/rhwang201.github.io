Clean : 195x2x3;185x2x2

Overhead Squat  : 125x2x5

Dip  :  45x8x3

Box jump : 105cmx3x3

### Notes

Still not there. Maybe a combination of not eating enough and the wine pairing. Receiving full cleans just kills you

OHS squat wasn't feeling stable. Usually in top third of movement. There's strength involved, use it.

Dips good, box jumps eh. May have also been new shoes

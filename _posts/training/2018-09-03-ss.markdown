Squat       :   215x5x3

Bench       :   195x5x3

Deadlift    :   280x5

Chinup      :   55x5x3

### Notes

Pretty good day. Practiced breathing with diaphragm for squats, helped. Really get that
big breath you can brace against. And keep back a bit tighter.

Bench must be easy, since I didn't need a spot.

Deads good, chest up a bit more.

Chinups easy.

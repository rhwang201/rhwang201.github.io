### Notes

Okay day, stomach still recovering from food poisoning. Squats were okay,
worked on fixing the rack, which is now marginally better. Think I'm more low
bar now. Just need to get more core tightness when stomach healthier.

Press was easy.

Deads were okay, kept the bar on the legs more. Make sure weight is on traps.

Dips were easy, cool.

Need to set some goals, so here they are. Short term first, recovering from
illness.
Squat: 255
Bench: 205
Deadlift: 335
Press: 135
Chinups: 45
Dips: 55

Next milestones:
Squat: 275
Bench: 215
Deadlift: 365
Press: 145
Chinups: 55
Dips: 75

Let's get to work.

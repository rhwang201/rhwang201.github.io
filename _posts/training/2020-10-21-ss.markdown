Power snatch :   100x3x3

Bench   :   170x5x3

Front squat   :   155x5x3

Dip  :   60x5,5,4

### Notes

Snatch okay...don't progress too fast, try to get some form work in? Receiving the bar in a pretty weak position

First set of bench not good, rest were solid

Front squat alright, a little hard, could be more balanced.

In a rush for dips, but pretty strong

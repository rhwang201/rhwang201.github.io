Power snatch :   105x3x3

Bench   :   170x5x3

Squat   :   215x5x3

Dip     :   70x5x3

### Notes

Power snatches pretty good, getting bar closer to the body/better turnover. One more time. High pulls help with form

Bench fine, a little uneven, can progress

Squats not bad, back feels a little loose sometimes but it's probably okay. Repeat

Dips hard, but got them. Progress

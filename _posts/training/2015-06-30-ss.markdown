Squat       :   220x5x3

Press       :   115x5x3

Dip         :   0x14x3

### Notes

Slept deeply last night. Standing up straight cue on squat really helps get my chest up
and my erectors strong. Squat was pretty good today.

Chest still tired, but press not very noteworthy.

Seems like I have a tendency to cut of ROM for dips.

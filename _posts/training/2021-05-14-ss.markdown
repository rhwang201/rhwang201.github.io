Snatch  : 95x3x4

Pullup  : 35x6x3

Pause squat :   195x5x3

Dip     :  45x6x3

Box Jump   :   105cmx3x3

### Notes

Alright day, light. Snatches okay, mostly playing with form. Don't cut extension short, also need to pull yourself under faster. Did some pulls at the end too

~3s pauses for squats, not bad except difficulty breathing with a mask on

Supersetted dips and jumps (got excited bc of a girl lol). Jumps were good! No hands, mostly clean landings

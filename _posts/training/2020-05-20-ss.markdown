### Notes

Mixed day, doesn't seem like I'm recovering fully. Snatch better, getting more vertical,
focused on keeping bar close to the body. Clean fine as usual, still a bit of arm rowing.

Snatch pull alight, not always getting contact in the hip (sometimes feels a bit earlier
in upper thigh). Good for feeling tension in back though, to prevent arm rowing, think
"tension triangle".

Press weak.

Lighter squats today to practice form.

Failed last OHS set.

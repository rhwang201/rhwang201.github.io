Squat       :   250x5x3

Bench       :   205x4

Chinup      :   30x5x5

### Notes

Shitty day. A little hungry. Squats were asymmetric. Lower left back hurts a bit. First
set sucked, corrected a bit on latter sets. Big breath, think of the pelvis. Should
probably take Monday light.

Bench wasn't that good either? Arms felt fine during squats (surprisingly), but elbows
were sore during bench? Could've gotten 5, but fire thoroughly deflated by this point.

Chins pretty good.

Squat : 195x6x3

Press : 95x8,8,6

Pullup  : 35x5x3

Dumbbell bench  : 50x11x3

Incline curl  : 27.5x9,9,8

Face pull : 50x12x3

### Notes

Squats were okay. Weight was forward on some initial reps, brought it back by the end. Tucking the tailbone felt good in staying upright. Weight on back was mostly nice

Press was hard, pretty good push though. Still light strain on right shoulder

Pullups super easy, maybe could jump 10

Dumbbell bench was hard, can go for 12. Careful putting the weight down when you're tired

Switched facepull grip, felt good

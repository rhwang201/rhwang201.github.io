Clean : 190x3x3

Overhead Squat  : 125x3x3

Dip  :  45x8x3

Curls : 17.5x12x3

Box jump : 107cmx3x5

### Notes

Cleans still hard lol but got it. Just no endurance, get super tired by third rep. Can progress I guess (or add more volume?)

OHS pretty easy actually, pushing up, torso pretty upright. Progress

Dips, curls good. A couple "cheated" jumps

Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   185x7x3

Deadlift    :   265x5

Pullup      :   75x3x3

Lateral Raise   :   25x10x3

### Notes

Not a bad day, maybe because of the Dragon Ball last night LOL. Squat warm ups were bad,
but working set better. "Shorten" back, take a big breath, tuck pelvis, and stay
back/tight.

Bench pretty good, it was a little hard.

Deads easy.

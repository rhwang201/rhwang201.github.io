Power clean :   190x3x3

Press   :   105x5x3

Squat   :   210x5x3

Chinup  :   70x5,4,4,3;45x5x2

### Notes

Cleans still not great, no stamina, receiving position feels weak (left shoulder). Two full cleans. Form looks good, maybe a bit more leg drive? Heels seem to be leaving the ground a bit early. Should probably decrease, or repeat. Also set back during setup

Press fine, progress by 5lb now?

Squats fine, descent slow and controlled (can probably speed it up a bit). Trying to balance thinking about hips with an upright position (the triangle). Progress

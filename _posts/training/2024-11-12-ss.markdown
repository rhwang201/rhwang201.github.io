Deadlift  :  345x5

Bench : 175x5x3

Row : 155x5x3

Tricep extension  :  35x12x3

Lateral raise  :  15x12x3

Neck extension  :  25x14x3

### Notes

Deads tough but got it.

Bench good, progress slowly

Rows pretty easy. Same with Tri's

Hm, maybe should be just doing the normal 20 reps for lateral raises

Neck a bit hard, especially with more unwieldly plate

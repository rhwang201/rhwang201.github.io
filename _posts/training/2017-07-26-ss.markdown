### Notes

Pretty good day. Did squats in front of a mirror. You are really asymmetric. Knees
forward a little more.

Press good.

Dips easy. Supersetted with facepulls. Used the cable machine in the back, it does units
per hand? (42.5). Focused on pointing outsides of arms towards the ceiling, felt it
decently.

Curls good, hanging leg lifts started off okay, but started swinging too much.

Abs dead during ab wheel, side planks pretty good.

Threw in a casual row for cardio.

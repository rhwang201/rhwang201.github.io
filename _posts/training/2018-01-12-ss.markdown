### Notes

Great day for upper body high-intensity. Squats were whatever, kept them light to work on
form. Main insight of the day was how to breathe correctly again. _Deep_ breath into the
abdomin, not "up" into the chest/shoulders. It really makes a huge difference in staying
tight.

With the improved breathing, press was great. Had to remind myself to keep the bar close
to the face on a couple reps. Also, focused on a tight grip (leaving fingerprints in the
bar). Good job.

Dip was good too, went a bit more aggressive finally. Keep weight "back".

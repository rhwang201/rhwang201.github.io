Squat       :   135x7x3

Bench       :   235x1

Deadlift    :   335x5

Dip         :   105x2,2,5

Curl        :   45x9x3

### Notes

Not a bad day, but felt sick at first? Might have been motion sickness from morning Uber
ride. Pause squats are feeling better. Did maybe one long pause of 5 seconds which was
good. Ass back, chest up.

Failed 250 miserably, got off chest maybe 4 inches. 235 wasn't very pretty either.

Deads not horrible. Erectors still pretty weak though, might've been too heavy. Be
cautious.

Dips are still easy, last set was AMRAP

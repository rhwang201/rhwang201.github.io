Snatch  : 100x3x3

Pullup  : 55x5,5,4,3

Squat :   215x5x3

Dip     :  55x7x3

Box Jump   :   107cmx3x3

### Notes

Not enough sleep. Snatch was meh again, missed a rep. Not able to receive in a strong position, kind of receiving and then squatting down. Continue working at it.

Pullups okay, think I need to repeat.

Pause squats pretty good on descent and pause, but not maintaining back angle on way up. Could maybe actually repeat

Dips good, hard

Box jumps hard, repeat. Maybe use foam pads instead of a plate

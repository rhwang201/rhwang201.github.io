Squat:          225x5;185x5x2

Press:          115x5x3

Deadlift:       275x5

### Notes

Still recovering from food poisoning. Squat rack was not great. Decent
tightness in hole and rebound, actually.

Press was incredibly easy at bottom.

Deads were okay, need to concentrate on staying tight at bottom (or reconsider
start position) to avoid hips shooting up. Kept bar on legs and pushed floor
through heels.

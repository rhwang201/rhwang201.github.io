Squat       :   195x5x3

Bench       :   190x5x3

Deadlift    :   305x5

Chinup      :   35x5,5,5,3,4

### Notes

Squat definitely a lot better, keeping it more back. Ironically, having the full length
mirror helps. Still a bit of pain in lower left back, need to keep trunk tight.

Bench was pretty good, try to get a good bar...Also, keep it by your nipples.

Dead was okay, had to alternate. Get chalk.

Chins were proof that you aren't trying very hard...

### Notes

Meh day, seems like tweaked lower back. Squats were okay, doing a better job of keeping
legs tight. Rack can be better though, get the weight on the back.

Press was good for the most part! Keeping the bar close to face and getting under.

Power cleans no bueno. Bruising just under the knee, not getting to jumping position, not
racking it cleanly. Lower weight.

Dips good.

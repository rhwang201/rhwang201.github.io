Squat       :   225x5x3

Press       :   125x5,5,4,1

Power Clean :   160x3x5

Dip         :   85x5x3


### Notes

Lifting consistency shaky recently. Squats alright, trying to keep neck area relaxed, and
anterior side of body "forward".

Tired for press.

Power cleans okay, but also tired.

Good effort on dips.

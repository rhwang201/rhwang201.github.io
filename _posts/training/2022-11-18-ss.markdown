### Notes

Late-ish post

Cleans really good. Warmup sets felt heavy, but working sets moved well. Good bar path, back felt tight

Bench was solid, felt easier than prior time

Cable rows hard, not great ROM at the ends

Pallof press easy, BSS medium, dumbbell press easy, woodchopper's were fatigued from press

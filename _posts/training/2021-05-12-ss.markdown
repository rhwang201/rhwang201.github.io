Power snatch :   115x0

Bench   :   185x5x3

Squat   :   240x5x3

Dip     :   70x5x3

### Notes

Pretty rough day, couldn't get tight for anything. Missed pretty much all snatches, even during warmup and a 105 backoff. Couldn't rack solidly. Probably need a focused technique day

Bench was hard but alright. Maybe repeat

Squats really hard (difficult to stay tight). Last set better but still not great. Repeat

Dips hard by last set but got it. Can progress

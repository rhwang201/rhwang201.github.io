### Notes

Good day! Squats a lot better. Think I was tighter because there was a cute girl, lol.
Rack was good, chest was up, shoulders down, rear delts engaged. Good job sitting back,
not moving knees in the hole, and keeping weight even during ascent.

Press was straightforward.

Power cleans alright. Got all the reps, but I don't think form is that great. Elongate
the back, keep the bar on the legs, and make sure to do the second pull. Every now and
then, you do a rep where it feels different. Using more hamstrings. Also, less jumpy off
the floor. Maybe you're doing that kick thing when you jump, maybe should read SS guid
again.

Dips good, could be back a bit more.

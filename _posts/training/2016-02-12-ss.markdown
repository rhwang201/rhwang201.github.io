Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   215x3

Dip         :   90x3

### Notes

Caltrain delayed and peeved about work, so not the best day for focus. Also didn't sleep
enough. Squat a little hectic, kept back tight sometimes, but overall regressed a bit,
due to rushed warmup. Better rack, back tight, stay balanced on ascent.

Bench okay.

Stayed tight in hole for dip.

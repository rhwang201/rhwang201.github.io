Power clean : 175x2x4

Bench : 140x11x3

Pallof press  : 25x13x3

Dumbbell press  : 35x11x3

Bulgarian split squat : 70x11x3

Cable lateral raise : 10x10,10,9

### Notes

Cleans were good, way better than last time. Tight back, stayed over the bar, drove up on contact. Weight was maybe a bit forward during the pull. Can do sets of 3

Bench also good, better than last time

Pallof good, doing one second hold

Press ROM at top not great

BSS hard, started with right (weak) leg this time, second leg just always burns

First time doing cable lateral raises, probably go lighter? Also, right shoulder mobility not great, maybe work on that

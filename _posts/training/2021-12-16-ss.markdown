Clean : 200x3x3

Overhead Squat  : 130x3x3

Dip  :  45x9,9,6

Box jump : 109cmx2x3

### Notes

Cleans pretty good! Still cutting extension/leg drive short, can work on that. Good height and quicker getting under the bar...Could progress or repeat

OHS finicky. Missed first rep of second set, repeated and it was okay. Very technique dependent. Pull your shoulders "out" of the socket. Also take it slow. Probably repeat

Dips good, not sure if last set 6 or 7

not really full landings on box jumps

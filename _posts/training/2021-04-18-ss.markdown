### Notes

Cleans not great, last rep was a full clean? It's okay to be a bit more aggressive on the receive and stomp, I think. Overall felt heavy and slow, and loose on the receive.

Press not very strong, also not sure how many reps I actually did (you got distracted again by some females today; also a little sleepy)

Squats were great, best they've been in a while. Repeating was a great call. More upright, maintained back angle on the ascent, open chest. Can progress

Chins were fine, but missed again

Threw in clean pulls for fun

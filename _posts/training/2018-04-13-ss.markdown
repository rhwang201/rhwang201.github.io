### Notes

Okay day. Squats getting better, but not there yet. Spend more time during warmup on
technique. Tuck the pelvis, sit down, and lean over near bottom of hole.

Press still really weak, failed 155. Need to get weight centered over forearm. Think the
squeezing technique of late has shifted the weight in the hand.

Power cleans easy? Make sure arms have no slack (chest up), and pushing through the heels
after the knees to get to a vertical jumping position.

Dips easy. Similar to press, need to make sure weight is even on working sets.

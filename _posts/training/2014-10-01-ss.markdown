Front Squat :   165x5x3

Bench       :   190x5x3

Power Clean :   160x3x5

Dips        :   45x10,10,6

### Notes

Front squats were okay, keep back more upright. Bench was pretty good actually,
but there is a noticeable sticking point off of the chest. Avoid bouncing too
much, focus hard on gripping the bar. Also, externally rotating during setup
helps a lot. Power cleans were pretty good, but need to be careful with the
rack and left wrist. Maybe ice the wrist so it recovers. Dips are still strong,
make sure depth is good though.

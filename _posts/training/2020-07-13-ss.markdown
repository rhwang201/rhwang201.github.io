Snatch work :   95x3x3

Clean pull :   185x3x3

Push Press  :   140x3x3

Squat   :   230x5x3

Chinup  :   65x5,4,4


### Notes

Snatches not good, get it lighter to get the form right. Be more patient with first pull,
so you can get into a good power position.

Wrist still not great for clean.

PP alright.

Squat feels a little wonky at times, but looks fine.

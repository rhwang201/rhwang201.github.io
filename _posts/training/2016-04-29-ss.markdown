Squat       :   195x7x3

Bench       :   215x3

Dip         :   90x2x4,5x1

### Notes

Not a bad day. Been getting good sleep. Also, journaling in the evening perhaps lets me
be a bit calmer on my morning commute haha. Squat wasn't bad! Rack is okay (still
squeezing the bar a bit), but focused on keeping bar back and pelvis tight. Feeling good
about it.

Bench was horrible. Got a spot from someone new, so didn't set up well, rushed through
it. Really should've gotten 4,5. Shoulders were loooosey goosey.

Dips were good! Was not expecting this at all. Had to make sure I went deep enough with
occassional glances at mirror, as my intuition apparently is off. Guess you can be more
aggressive with this.

### Notes

Snatch better, I think this amount of rowing is fine. Knee scoop and second pull seem
decent, maybe it's just a matter of adding the gas now.

Failed 180 clean, was too tired. Lower weights went well. Think I need to switch up
programming for cleans, maybe two heavy a week?

Push press not great, need to deload I think.

Deload on squat (it mostly looks fine).

Internal rotation on OHS?

Limited ROM on chins.

Power clean :   155x3x3

Bench   :   155x5x3

Squat   :   185x5x3

Dip     :   45x5x3

### Notes

Cleans not bad. Took a video, a bit of arm bend, but seems okay. Think 2x at a weight is good.

Bench good, slow down progression to 5lb

Squats good! 3/1/0 on warmups really help find balance. Then able to go quickly on working set and maintain form.

Same on dips, slow down progression now

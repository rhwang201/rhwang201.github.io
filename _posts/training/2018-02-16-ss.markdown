### Notes

Squat...has room to improve. Focused on elbows down, bar path, and pelvis. Pelvis wasn't
always in perfect position in the hole. Really get that chest up, flex those abs, and
keep that pelvis neutral. Don't be eager to increase weight.

Press pretty good. Squeeze, keep it even, and get under it.

Power cleans seem to be better. Increasing the speed. Just keep on improving the top of
the movement.

Dips pretty good, remember to keep the weight back and look straight ahead.

Deadlift  : 330x5x3

Bench : 170x5x3

Chinup  : 45x7,6,6

Incline dumbbell bench  : 40x11x3

Chest supported row : 25x12x3

Cable crossover : 40x13x3

### Notes

Deads hard but good again. Lower back felt a bit strained. I'd say repeat one time

Bench good, nice reset. Can progress.

Probably too hard doing chin and pullup strength twice in a week

Incline good, first set shoulder felt strained

Rows light, crossovers hard (good)

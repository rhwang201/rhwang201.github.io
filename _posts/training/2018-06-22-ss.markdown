### Notes

Good day. Waking up early recently. Kept squats "lighter", seems like a good call.
Re-remembered the cue "chest up to the chin". Squats overall were good, stayed back on
a lot of reps.

Press alright.

Power cleans better than previous workout. The movement felt slower and more clear during
the second pull, which is good.

Great job on dips! Pussied out on last rep though.

Curls were good. Going all the way to the bottom gets a good stretch.

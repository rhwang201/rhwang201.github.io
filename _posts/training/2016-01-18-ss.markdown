Squat       :   185x5x5

Press       :   120x5x5

Deadlift    :   225x5x3

Chinup      :   40x5x4,3

### Notes

Shitty recovery this weekend, not enough sleep. Squat sucks, go light. First rep of each
set is always tight and great, then you lose it.

Press was okay, stayed tight throughout the entirety of many reps.

Probably shouldn't have even tried deadlifts.

Chins not bad.

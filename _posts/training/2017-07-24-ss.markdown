### Notes

Really good day. Bike-commuted today. Squats were okay, knee should be good for squatting
now. Ass back more, brace everything.

Bench was pretty good. Would've gotten 5x3 with a spotter.

Dead pretty good, push through heels. Supersetted with lateral raises.

Doing proper chinups now (as opposed to neutral-grip). Supersetted with knee tucks,
killer.

Stair intervals.

Couch stretch, squat.

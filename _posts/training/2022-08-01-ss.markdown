Squat : 230x5x3

Power clean : 180x3x3

Chinup  : 65x5x3

Tricep extension : 42.5x7x3

Dumbbell row  : 70x10x3

Incline hammer curl : 25x12x3

Bench : 95x5,5,7,7

### Notes

Squat hard. Decent bounce, also focus on bar over midfoot. Back could be more upright. Repeat-ish

Power cleans okay, focus on being strong at the bottom before exploding. Repeat

Reset chins

Shoulder okay for bench, be careful, not too much volume/intensity

### Notes

Wow, pretty strong today? Kept squats light, good call, form a little better. Was using
other bar though. Set the torso at the top (chest up, abs crunched), then focus on hips
during movement.

Press was surprising, wow.

Power cleans okay, definitely shrugging during second pull now. Think about "compacting"
the lats during set up.

Snatch :   100x2x4

Push press  : 125x3x3

Front squat   :   195x3x3

Dip      :   70x5x3

### Notes

Rough day. Failed 105 at the beginning and end. Was pretty much powering some reps, overhead position in the hole weak

Push press also weaker than I remember, a little loose

Front squats hard, trying to stay over midfoot, think you're a bit forward

Dips hard too but pushed through

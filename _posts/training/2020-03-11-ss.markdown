### Notes

Not bad day. Need to explode more on snatch.

Grip tired for slow pull, but with rests can do it.

Make sure to drive hard on PP, should be main focus.

Front squat better, still need to keep weight even on ascent.t 

Same with back squat, good job thinking of ass. Also think about knees; they don't move
after roughly halfway.

Stand tall for OHS.

Dips easy.

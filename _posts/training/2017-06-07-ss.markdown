Squat       :   195x5x3

Bench       :   175x5x3

Deadlift    :   275x5

Back Extension  :   0x12x3

Leg Lift    :   0x12x3

### Notes

Was excited, but not a great workout. Slipping forward on squats in the bottom, can feel
anterior hip being pulled. Bigger breath, and set trunk tighter.

Bench was meh too, pretty uneven. Maybe need to set shoulders back in socker better?

Deads w/e, form was off (maybe feeling nervous about back).

Threw in back extensions/leg lifts for w/e (dose abs). Neck/anterior shoulder + anterior
hip mobility.

Squat       :   185x5x3

Bench       :   182.5x5x3

Power Clean :   152.5x3x5

### Notes

Chainsmokers last night, so nutrition and sleep lacking, drank a bit.

Squats as usual were overall a bit too low. There were some good reps though.
Can still do 10lb jumps!

Bench was pretty easy actually. Some reps were too high, some were uneven. The
last set was good.

Power cleans were okay. I think to keep the arms straight, I need to learn to
have the weight hang off of the traps again.

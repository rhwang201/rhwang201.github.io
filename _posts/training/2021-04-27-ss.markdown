Power clean :   185x3x3

Press   :   125x5,5,3

Squat   :   225x5x3

Chinup  :   65x5,5,4

### Notes

Cleans alright, still receiving pretty low, but a bit more aggressive. Make sure the second pull is clean (close to the legs, no arm bend fluid). Think there was a full clean in there, so repeat

Press was strong at first! But not enough stamina for last set. Good grip strength.

Squats were good except for one or two reps that weren't smooth. Good job gripping the floor with your whole foot to help keep you balanced (feels like knees go more forward). Can progress

Stalling on chins, repeat

Remember to film the oly lifts

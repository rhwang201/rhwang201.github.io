Squat       :   235x5x3

Press       :   135x3

Chinup      :   60x5

### Notes

Sick, but being stubborn, you came into work so you could train. Mucus-y throat, light
headed, overall weakness. Distrated during squat (lol you fucktard), right elbow and
shoulder pain. It really wasn't bad though. Key is to keep abs tight.

Not actually sure how many I got for press...Also need to keep abs tight.

Chins were surprisingly strong and easy, especially when last week is taken in
consideration.

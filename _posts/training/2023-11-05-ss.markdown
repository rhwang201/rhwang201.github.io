Squat : 195x5x3

Dumbbell press  : 60x4x4

Pullup  : 65x6,6,6,5

Incline dumbbell press : 70x7,7,5

Incline curl  :  22.5x13,12,10

Lateral raise : 20x12x3

### Notes

Good job resetting squats. Go slowly (and maybe consider alternative leg exercises?)

Press was heavy. Can go one more time for strength

Careful with incline, shoulder is at risk

"Cheating" on lateral raises

Snatch :   110x2x5

Push press  : 145x3x3

Front squat   :   210x3x3

Dip      :   80x5,5,4

### Notes

Snatch better. Failed one forward. "Jumping" on warmups, which I think is a good sign. Still receiving in a power, but stronger position today. Focus on speed under the bar

Push press not bad, focus on driving.

Front squats okay, thought about tripod. Progress

Reset dips?

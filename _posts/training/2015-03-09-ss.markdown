Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   200x5x5

Deadlift    :   305x5,225x8

### Notes

Squat was not great. Rack wasn't perfect, and it felt pretty heavy. Should
probably change to 5lb jumps now. Watch the right anterior hip...some light
irritation this morning.

Bench was hard. First set already felt heavy. Also my right shoulder wasn't
great. Grinded through all of them though. Be conscious of the right shoulder.

Deads were easy.

Squat, overhead mob.

Squat : 215x3x3

Dumbbell press  : 50x11,11,10

Pullup  : 65x5x3

Incline dumbbell press : 55x12,12,9

Curls : 25x11,10,10

Lateral raise : 12.5x14x3

### Notes

Camping, so recovery meh. Also right hip flexor a bit injured.

Squats fine, heels coming up a bit? Good job driving against upper triangle, and being tight in the hole.

Bad ROM on pullups and lateral raises at the end

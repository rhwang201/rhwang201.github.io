Squat : 205x5x3

Power clean : 165x3x3

Bench : 170x5x3

Chinup  : 70x5,5,4

Dumbbell press  : 40x11,11,10,5

Dumbbell row  : 65x9x3

### Notes

Squats okay, weight forward at first. Back angle could stay more even. 5lb jumps now probably

Power cleans a bit meh, starfishing and not great racks. Repeat

Bench fine actually, getting more aggressive setup

Forearms fatigued from rockclimbing

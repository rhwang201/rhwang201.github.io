### Notes

Higher reps today, decent sleep last night. Squats a lot better. Remember, knees out
(don't let arch collapse). Squats good today. Also, externally rotate shoulders before
getting into rack.

Press good, was fast (held breath for five reps).

Power cleans started off bad, then got better. Chest up, get on the heels.

Dips pretty strong.

Curls with barbell.

Front squat : 200x3x3

Press : 120x4,4,4,3

Deadlift  : 280x5x3

Pendlay row : 145x8x3

Dip : 60x5x3

Curl  : 50x11x3

### Notes

Front squats good, focused on knees more forward

Press hard. Did more external rotation at the bottom for a "bigger platform"

Deads not bad, arms are more like ropes, though still occasionally shrugging at the top. Probably should start alternate grip

Rows easy actually.

Dips okay. Stay tight and "back"

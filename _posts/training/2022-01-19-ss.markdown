Snatch :   115x2,1

Push press  : 160x2,1

Front squat   :   215x3x3

Dip      :   80x5x3

### Notes

Rough day, physically and mentally. Snatch height there, just not catching it strong. Really gotta brace everything tight for the overhead position. Also, some rowing/sweeping during the second pull

Push press rough too

Reset front squats a bit. Take a big breath, tripod, chest up. Form doesn't feel that much better compared to 225...

Dips hard but got it

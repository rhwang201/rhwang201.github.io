Squat       :   190x5x3

Bench       :   180x5x3

Deadlift    :   255x5

Chinup      :   45x5,5,4

Skullcrusher    :   40x8x3

### Notes

Just going by pounds now and converting. Feel a bit sick/weak again..(?). Squats were
pretty good, felt like got in the hole great. Really balanced, also keep the back tight
to help with the strong ascent.

Bench was alright.

Dead super easy.

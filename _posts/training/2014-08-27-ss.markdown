Squat:          135x5x5

Press:          127.5x5,3,3

Deadlift:       225x5x3

### Notes

Overall today was tough. Very emotionally distracted.

Squat form was okay, need to work on rack. Read about the setup again. Too much
pressure was on left shoulder.

Press was no good. May need to reset.

Deadlift was meh.

Squat       :   220x5x3

Bench       :   180x5x3

Deadlift    :   335x5;245x10

### Notes

Couldn't sleep for a while last night. Squat was pretty shitty. 1 right ankle was
stressed in the hole, 2 rack was bad. Next workout, will be very cautious with weight and
form.

Upper body wasn't feeling great from shitty rack, but got the weight up for bench.

Deads were okay. Could set up a little tighter, and lean back a bit more.

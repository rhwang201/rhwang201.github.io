### Notes

Heavy singles again pretty good. Staying tight off the floor, knuckles down, pushing the floor away. Bar tight, full commit, good rack. Stick fucking around on lighter drop off set though, treating it like it's a "joke". Stop doing that.

Everything else pretty good (neutral grip for chins).

Squat       :   185x5x3

Bench       :   165x5x3

Back Extension  :   70x6x4

Facepull    :   45x15x4

### Notes

Not a bad day. Left adductor was a little tweaked for squats. Had a really good rack
going for warmups at one point. Squats were okay, could have focused more on keeping
lower back and trunk rigid.

Bench whatever. Right wrist a little injured from volleyball.

Back extensions were pretty tough at first, especially since I was trying to figure out
how to hold the two plates. Last set was better though once I could focus on exertion
rather than form.

Facepulls not bad.

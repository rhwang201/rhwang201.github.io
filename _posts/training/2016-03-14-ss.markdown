Chinup      :   45x5x2,4x1,3x1

### Notes

Meh weekend of recovery. Think I should really eat more. Squats weren't bad actually!!
Hamstring strill hurt. Rack was good (do that shoulder move-y thing, set up, rotate chest
up). Sat into hole well. Easy does it.

Press wasn't bad actually, but definitely uneven. Torso leaning towards right side.

Deads tiring, potentially deteriorating form.

Tired as fuck for chins.

Pistol  :   0x10x3

Turkish Get Up   :   45x3,3,2.5

Box Jump   :   105cmx3x3

Dip     : 45x7x3

Overhead squat  : 95x3x3

Pullup    : 25x7,7,5

### Notes

Pistols not bad. Left side definitely weaker and worse at balancing. Try to get free leg out in front. Let's get to sets of 12, then add weight

TGU alright, still missed last rep on left side

Box jumps better! Less hands, although still using them as a safety crutch I think. Should probably focus on committing during warmups. Could maybe progress.

Dips easy

Ego got in the way of OHS, weight on balls of the feet for some reps. Repeat

### Notes

Shitty day at first. Horrible recovery this weekend.  Pause squats horribly forward, felt
really hard. Hips and back not in great shape.

Press hard as hell too. Uneven torso when going under.

Chins strong though! Even listend to conversation as doing a set haha.

Supersetted shrugs with curls, grip got tired.

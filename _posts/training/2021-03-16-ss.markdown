Power snatch :   100x3x3

Bench   :   160x5x3

Squat   :   205x5x3

Dip     :   60x5x3

### Notes

Not the best day, I think insufficient recovery lead to bad technique. Snatches not great, not enough heights, not receiving in strong positions. Repeat

Bench fine, a bit asymmetric.

Squats meh. Back not tight enough. Repeat.

Dips easy-ish

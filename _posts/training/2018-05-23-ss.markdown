Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   165x5x3

Deadlift    :   265x5

Chinup      :   25x5x3

Lateral Raise   :   20x10x3

Crunch Machine  :   80x10x3

### Notes

Not a full nights sleep or enough calories, but felt okay. Squats still not good, take
Friday light and get form correct. Not sitting into hole and loading posterior chain
correctly.

Bench easy.

Deads good. Chest up to tighten, bar against the leg, push through the heels

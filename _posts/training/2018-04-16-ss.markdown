### Notes

Pretty good day. Squat form a lot better, back is becoming tight again. Looking forward
helps with leaning over and getting into hole. Tighten lats to get a "short" back. Along
with tucking pelvis, gets the entire back tight.

Bench okay. Got a spot and met David. Make sure weight is over forearms and "down" more
towards the nips.

Deads okay. Did some dropoffs are 225, and they were much better. Same thing with squats;
need to get that back tightness.

Chins pretty weak. Grip especially is not great. Should work on that.

Lateral raises strong.

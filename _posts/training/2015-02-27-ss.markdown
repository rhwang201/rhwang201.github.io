Squat       :   175x5x5

Bench       :   215x3,2

Deadlift    :   265x5x3

### Notes

Gah, frustrating day. Squat was going okay, but got distracted by a call from
my mother.

Bench, fuck. Freaking spotter touched the bar when I slowed down a bit and
threw me off. I would've gotten five...

Deads were pretty easy, sans a cut on my leg. Did a ~10s hold at the end for
grip strength.

Overhead and hip mobility.

Pistol  :   0x4x5

Turkish Get Up   :   30x3x3

Box Jump   :   42inx3x5

Row      :  45x12x3

### Notes

Supersetted pistols with TGH, both are fine

Box jump had an additional 25lb plate. Some reps weren't clean, and you aren't landing with your weight even (backwards), so can probably repeat.

Did a supine machine thing for rows. Can probably do close grip bench or stuff if you want hypertrophy, wasn't very interested

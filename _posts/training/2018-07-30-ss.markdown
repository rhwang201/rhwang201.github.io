### Notes

Pretty good day. Squats weren't bad, make sure to keep back angle constant on ascent.

Press was difficult, but got it. Last rep was a grinder. Decent job keeping the bar close
to the face.

Power cleans were okay. Initiate second pull _after_ bar clears the knees. Lengthen
spine, compact back.

Dips were pretty darn easy...

Front Squat :   185x5x3

Bench       :   192.5x5x3

Power Clean :   162.5x3x5

### Notes

Not the best recovery this weekend. Front squat is getting difficult, need to
begin 5lb jumps. Knees need to go more forward. I also need to be aware of my
tendency to shift weight to the balls of my feet.

Bench was shitty. Got the reps, but sacrificed form, bounching excessively and
letting the bar drift towards my head. Redo this weight. Maybe ask trainer for
a spot.

Cleans were okay. I took a video and found out after the bar crosses my knees,
I row it a bit to the jumping position. Need to fix that by really pulling all
slack out of my arms at the bottom.

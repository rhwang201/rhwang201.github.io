Power clean :   190x3x3

Press   :   125x5x3

Squat   :   230x5x3

Chinup  :   60x5x3

### Notes

Cleans alright. Form inconsistent, but height good. I'd say advance, but also get some technique in before

Press strong! Big breath, chest up. Can progress

Squats okay, variable. Knees more forward on some reps, back angle not always constant. Can progress, slowly.

Chins good, last rep hard but got it.

Power snatch :   95x3x3

Push Press   :   115x4x3

Squat   :   190x5x3

Chinup     :   35x5x3

### Notes

Rushed workout. Snatch okay, keep the back tight, bar close. Can progress slowly

No bench so push press. Form a lot better than before.

Squats okay, knee better, be careful with back

Chins easy

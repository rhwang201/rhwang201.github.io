Deadlift  :  340x5

Bench : 185x5,5,4

Cable row : 130x11,11,10

Tricep extension  :  35x12x3

Lateral raise  :  20x20x3

Neck extension  :  25x18,18,12

### Notes

Deads good. Can progress slowly? Set the scapula.

Bench solid, can repeat.

Everything else good for hypertrophy. Limited ROM on lateral raises, could lower weight

Neck, just front curl that's hard...

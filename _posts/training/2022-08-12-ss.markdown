### Notes

Squats pretty good, though about dropping...the gooch straight down, got good positioning as a result

Cleans meh. Lighter sets were good, but heavier set had a sloppy rack and starfishing

Deads okay, a bit of back strain, careful

Bench good! No pain. Focused on straight wrists and bar path

Full cans, 2.5x15x2

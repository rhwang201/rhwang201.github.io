### Notes

Tough day, definitely not recovering fully. Radial forearms a bit sore for snatch, make
sure arms are taut ("strings")

Cleans fine, leaning over a bit more.

Front squats okay, later reps are a little sloppy. Breath into belly, explode.

Squats good, look forward, back tight.

Rack not good for OHS, maybe fatique related. Make sure to lockout. Arms trying to go
wider than bar.

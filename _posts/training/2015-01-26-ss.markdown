Bench       :   195x5x3

Chinup      :   30x7,7,6,1

Back Extension : 10x10x3

### Notes

Pretty lackluster recovery this weekend, but it was a worthwhile tradeoff :).
Bench was pretty casual actually! Need to be a bit smoother in the bottom, but
I got a good stretch.

Chins were okay, almost past this weight...

Taking back extensions easy. No pain I think!

Squat       :   205x5x3

Press       :   145x1;115x5

Power Clean :   185x1x3

Dip         :   100x3x3


### Notes

Alright day. Not the strongest, but better form. Backed off on squats, form was better.
"Knees out" helped a lot.

Press was weak, wanted a double.

Power cleans alright, went into a full clean on last rep.

Dips pretty easy, just make sure to align wrist/palm.

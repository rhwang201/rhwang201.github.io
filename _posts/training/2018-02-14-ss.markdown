### Notes

Think "higher" on squat rack, to make sure the bar can sit on the rear delts, and you can
get your elbows "down", so that your chest is higher. Good job keeping bar path vertical
over midfoot. Make sure ass stays tight and back.

Bench good, thought about spreading and bending the bar.

Deads kind of hard, alternated the last two reps again.

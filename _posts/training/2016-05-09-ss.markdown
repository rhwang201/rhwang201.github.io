Squat       :   185x5x3

Bench       :   195x5x5;165x9

Dip         :   45x6x2,4x1;0x10,6

### Notes

Eh workout. Decent motivation (yay single life), but bad sleep all weekend. Did pause
squats today. Should lay off squats for a bit. Pain/impingement in left hip in hole.

Bench was uneven and not very tight (right wrist injury) but got everything. Left side
was lagging a lot.

Dips were fun.

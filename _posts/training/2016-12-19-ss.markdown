### Notes

Not much sleep recently. Working set of squats was meh. Went back later to do more, and
after having actually worked hard, was much more willing to put tension on ass, posterior
change/get tighter, and sat into hole well. Keep the knees stable.

Press was aight.

Dips were pretty good.

Curls good.

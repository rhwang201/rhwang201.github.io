Deadlift    :   320x5

Run         :   1 mile 6mph, 1 mile 7.5mph, 1 mile 8.1mph

Bench       :   175x5x3

Pullup      :   25x5x3

### Notes

Okay day. Still a challenge beginning workout with deadlifts. Alternate grip for entire
set.

Running getting better. Warming up is definitely very important.

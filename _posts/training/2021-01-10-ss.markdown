Power clean :   180x3x5

Press   :   120x5,5,3

Squat   :   205x5x3

Chinup  :   55x5x3

### Notes

Cleans okay, second set felt really easy. Think about back setup (both "chest up" and "tight lats"), keep the bar close to your legs during second pull. Should repeat once more

Press pretty hard. Exhaling after unracking seems to get me pretty loose.

Squats okay, a bit of good morning'ing on last reps. Can progress, I guess?

Last chin rep a bit short. Maybe can progress

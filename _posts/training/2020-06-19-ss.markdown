### Notes

Pretty good day. Practiced snatch, still not great. Because of anatomy, I think I still
need some amount of arm bend, but I'm pretty sure the current amount is excessive. Did
segment snatch pulls after.

Cleans were heavy, but still good.

Push press strong.

Squats pretty good too, starting to bounce a bit more, especially since getting better at
staying tight.

OHS alright, grip is the limiting factor it seems like. Chalk up.

Might need to switch to weekly programming for chins.

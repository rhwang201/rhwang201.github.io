Barbell curl    :   45x12,12,8

### Notes

Kept it light. Squats better. Main insight is to make sure weight is centered _before_
beginning descent, while just standing with the weight. Also, your imbalance varies
daily, need to be adaptive (ie, today, had to focus pretty far "back").

Press heavy, but fine.

Exhausted for cleans, last one was a full clean. Overall not bad, think about rapidly
changing back angle for second pull

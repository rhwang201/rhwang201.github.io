Squat       :   230x5x3

Press       :   120x5x3

Power clean :   165x3x5

Dip         :   75x5,5,3

### Notes

Meh day, might've been too aggressive with lifts. Squats were shitty, bad mobility. Not
tight.

Press was good actually.

Power cleans meh, get a cleaner rack. Get a more consistent setup.

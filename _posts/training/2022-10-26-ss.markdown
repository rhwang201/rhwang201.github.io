Deadlift  : 325x5x3

Bench : 155x7x3

Chinup  : 0x11,11,8

Cable crossover : 32.5x12x3

Incline hammer curl : 25x11x3

Lateral dumbbell raise  : 17.5x13x3

### Notes

Maybe a bit too heavy on deads. Back felt a bit tweaked upon waking up. Bar seemed to get a bit away from the body

Bench fine, rack setup a bit off/low

Everything else fine, think the air in that basement gym might be a bit off...

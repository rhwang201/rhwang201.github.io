Pistol  :   0x11x3

Box Jump   :   105cmx3x3

Dip     : 45x8x3

Overhead squat  : 95x3x3

Pullup    : 25x7,7,5

### Notes

Low on sleep, some of these counts may be inaccurate...Pistols eh, right side pretty hard. Should probably increase mobility

Box jumps okay, mostly the same as last time, using hands a little

Dips good

OHS better than last time

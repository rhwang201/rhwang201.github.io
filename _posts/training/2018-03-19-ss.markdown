### Notes

Pretty good day. Squats a lot better. Focused on "gripping" the floor, evening weight out
between ball of foot and heel. In general, can still be a bit more back on the ascent.

Bench good. Good setup. Also, though about aggressively arching even during a set. Will
need a spotter soon...

Deads good, despite the annoying scab on left knee. Hips higher as a result of setup,
like before. Chest up, elongated neck. Back feels tight now, in a good way.

Chins good, focused on really gripping the bar, and also relaxing the pelvis and
tensioning the abs

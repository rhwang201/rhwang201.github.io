Snatch :   105x2x5

Push press  : 145x3x3

Front squat   :   210x3x3

Dip      :   75x5x3

### Notes

Good job keeping it light. Snatches not bad, good height and turnover. Can have a smoother second pull (less rowing) and receive deeper

Front squats okay, a bit on the toes. Initial reps good, keeping trunk vertical

dips hard

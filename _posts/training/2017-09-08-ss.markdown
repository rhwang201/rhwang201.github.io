### Notes

Not a bad day, despite lackluster sleep of late. Have good form, but don't be afraid to
get a bit heavier on squats. Squats not bad, stay back and load posterior chain, keep
everything tight.

Press okay, brace abs and grind.

Dips pretty good.

Threw in lat pulldowns for hypertrophy.

Running good.

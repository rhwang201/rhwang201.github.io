Snatch :   110x2,3,3

Push press  : 150x3x3

Front squat   :   220x3x3

Dip      :   80x5,5,4

Curl      :   20x13x3

### Notes

Mentally tough at first with the snatch, but got better with Mike's help and extra time in the gym. Focusing on elbows for the snatch, think it's helping with turnover a lot. Panda pull complexes throughout the workout helped a lot

Push press easy today! Some dips weren't super tight, work on that.

Front squat okay, still pretty difficult. Can advance though.

Dips were good, just not enough in the tank

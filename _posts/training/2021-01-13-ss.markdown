Power snatch :   110x2;105x2x2

Bench   :   175x5x3

Squat   :   210x5x3

### Notes

Pretty poor day, probably from skipping lunch and getting paged. Snatches really bad, poor racks and height. Form practice and chill

Bench not bad, could repeat or progress

Squats okay, still some good morning'ing on later reps

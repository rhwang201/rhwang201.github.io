Snatch  : 95x2x4

Pullup  : 35x7,7,4

Box Jump   :   107cmx3x3

Pause squat :   185x5x3

Bench     :  165x6x3

### Notes

Played around with full snatches, not bad! Should probably record. Need to figure out what to do now...

Had a 25 on the boxes. Not great, didn't really land any to be honest

Pause squats were good, stayed tight during all parts, worked abs coming out of hole

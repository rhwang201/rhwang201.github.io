Front Squat :   195x5x3

Bench       :   192.5x5x2,4

Power Clean :   165x3x5

### Notes

Not the best recovery last night, couldn't sleep very well. Front squat was
pretty bad, back probably was not very tight, too much ass up.

Bench was shitty. Probably could've gotten it with a spotter. Try one more time
then reset.

PCs were shitty too. Some terrible jumps and racks...Sigh

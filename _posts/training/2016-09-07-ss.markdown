Squat       :   185x7x5

Press       :   105x8x3

Dip         :   80x5x5

Curl        :   20x10x3; 45x6x2

### Notes

Okay day, woke up earlier. I thought squats were okay, but lower back feels a bit
tweaked. Focused on standing up tall, setting pelvis, not moving knees in hole (!), and
sitting back.

Press was pretty easy.

Dips were hard, but gottem.

Nice pump on incline bench curls, did bar after.

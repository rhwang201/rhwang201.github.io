Squat       :   210x5x3

Press       :   125x4,4,3;110x5

Power clean :   160x3x5

Dip         :   90x2x3

### Notes

Weak day, most things too heavy. Getting loose in squats, hips popping on first sets.
Also, don't feel lower back tightness contributing in a good way anymore. Don't progress.

Press also very heavy.

Cleans meh, wouldn't progress.

Dips good.

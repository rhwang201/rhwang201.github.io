Squat:      95

Bench:      172.5x5x3

Power Clean:   142.5x5x3

### Notes

Practiced squat form again today. Did some in front of mirror and they seemed
better than those not. Focus on not going too deep, keeping lower back tight,
staying tight in the hole, and driving up with hips.

Bench pretty good, did 4-rep breaths.

Power cleans pretty good. Did a good job of tightening at bottom and lowering
hips a bit. Also focused on second pull and having a more upright back at
jumping position. Be careful of left wrist.

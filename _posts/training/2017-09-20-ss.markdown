### Notes

Not a bad day. Didn't sleep enough last night, also went to sleep hungry. Squats are
okay, try to keep neck/upper back relaxed. Straight bar path over midfoot.

Bench super easy. Squeezed bar, lightly touched chest (imagining a piece of glass),
explosive.

Back was a bit off during deadlift warmups, but got better. Chest up, and bar against
leg.

Chins "center of gravity" a bit off without weights.

Lateral raises easy.

Back extension volume good.

Did overhead stretch, hip external rotators, and couch stretch. Should consider doing hip
external rotator stretch before squatting.

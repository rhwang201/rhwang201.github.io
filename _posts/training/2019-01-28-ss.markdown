Squat       :   225x5x3

Bench       :   195x5,5,4;165x7;135x10

Deadlift    :   340x3,2

Chinup      :   65x5,5,4,3

### Notes

Body pretty beat from weekend (probably lack of sleep). Squats alright, good "chest up"
and engaging posterior chain. Still can stay a bit more balanced though.

Bench was a little instable. Did some extra sets at end of workout.

Too tired for deads...

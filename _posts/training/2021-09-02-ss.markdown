Snatch :   85x2x5;95x1x3

Chinup      :   85x2x3

Squat    :  185x7x3

Dip   : 95x2x3

### Notes

Good day. Pulling under the snatch more. Lots of form practice. Pulls with pause at knee, then full snatch. Can really feel when you full yourself under and time it correctly. Just need to get leg/knee position solid and consistent

Everything else fine

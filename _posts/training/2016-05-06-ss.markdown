Squat       :   135x5x3

Press       :   130x3x5

Chinup      :   100x1

### Notes

Not a horrible day. Lower back is _fucked_ up. Kept squats light, and did pause squats,
as I noticed I was shifting my weight forward all the time. Lower back hurts afterwards
now too.

Press was surprisingly good! Kept trunk rigid, bar close to face, and moved under the
bar.

Chinup was okay, didn't get full ROM.

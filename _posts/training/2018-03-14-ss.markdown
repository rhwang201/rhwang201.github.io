### Notes

Meh day. Squats aren't good. Overall, too loose in the hole. Don't increase weight. Make
sure weight is over midfoot and back is tight.

Bench good.

Deads better (?) Focused more on "chest up" during setup, ie didn't move hips after
setting shins against the bar. Grip a little weak (double overhand).

Squat       :   175x5x3

Press       :   105x5x3

Back Extension  :   25x12x5

Facepull    :   40x15x3

### Notes

Lower left back hurt a bit? Odd. Squats were okay, not the best. Legs and such were sore.
Sets got better though.

Press was unremarkable. Neck still sore. Sets also got better.

Back extensions felt easy.

Facepulls were good.

Power clean :   150x3x3

Bench   :   145x5x3

Squat   :   180x5x3

Dip     :   35x5x3

### Notes

Cleans getting harder, make sure you finish the explosion and rack well.

Bench easy, strength coming back. Good grip.

Squat not bad, thoracic spine much tighter (chest up)

Dips easy

OHS mobility still there (did some reps w/ bar).

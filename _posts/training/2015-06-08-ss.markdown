Squat       :   185x5x3

Press       :   125x5x5

Deadlift    :   395x5

Chinup      :   40x5x3,4x2

### Notes

More pause squat practice, but anterior right hip not feeling good. Not good balance or
mobility in the hole today. I hope you realize how pathetic your squat is...

Backed away from planned 130, got 125 alright. Not feeling especially strong.

Re-did deadlift, it was pretty good. Need to keep back tight and chest up on latter reps.

Chinups were hard, even with 2m15s rest.

### Notes

Not a bad day. Squats a lot better than end of last week. Focused on "tucking" the pelvis
and sitting "down" in the hole. Doing some pauses during warmups helps. Set chest at the
top, then think about hips during the movement.

Press was weak because of weak shoulders.

Power cleans okay. Need to make sure arms are taut.

Upper body felt really strong on dips, good job. Take your time in setting the grip.

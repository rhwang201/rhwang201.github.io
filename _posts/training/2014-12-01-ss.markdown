### Notes

Squat was harder than expected. Got all reps, and videos looked decent. Some
reps, I dropped into the hole too hard, others were good. I think I'm just
fatigued. Will probably have a light day next session. Focus on keeping the
trunk tight, thinking about 'up' on the descent.

Was pretty nervous about the press, as always at 135. Could've gotten it, but
some shaky reps on the first two sets tired me out. You'll get it next time.
Make sure the descent is nice and controlled, and get under the bar _fast_.

Deads were good. Grip just about gave out though, might need alternate next
time (or just better/more chalk). Sucking in the abs helped a lot.

Dips just for fun haha. Pretty tired.

Also, feel very sharp after working out woo. Such a good feeling. I just
focused really well on a reading piece.

Ofgaetz.

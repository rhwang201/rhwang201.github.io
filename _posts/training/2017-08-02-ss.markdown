### Notes

Pretty good day. Barely had dinner last night, though, so was starving during the
workout. Squats are getting better. This was maybe a bit heavy. Pull pelvis forward into
position with the abs.

Bench was easy.

Deads pretty good. Keep bar on the legs, push through the heels, hollow abs in setup,
think about passing the knees first, on ascent.

Chins easy.

Squat       :   215x5x3

Bench       :   200x5x3

Deadlift    :   325x5

Chinup      :   90x1;0x8x3

GHR         :   0x4x3

### Notes

Squat okay, should repeat weight. Was a bit forward, posterior chain not tight throughout
ascent.

Bad spotter on bench. Got first two sets solidly. Spotter helped on last one. Re-do.

Deads were pretty good, got chalk. Stay back, squeeze the bar off the floor.

Chins for fun.

GHR for fun.

Squat:          135x5x3

Press:          115x5x3

Deadlifts:      235x5

### Notes

Want to start back squatting again. Take it slowly and get the form down. Hip
cracked sometimes at bottom. Rack position sucks, right shoulder got tired
sometimes. Back felt a bit funny by end of workout.

Press was okay. Coming down was pretty bad though.

Deadlift was okay, as well.

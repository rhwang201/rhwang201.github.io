Bench       :   175x5x3

Dip         :   25x12,12,6

Squat       :   145x5x3

Power Clean :   145x3x5

### Notes

Bench was mostly easy and good. In general, aim a bit lower on the chest.

Dips were good. Nice to get some arm work in haha.

Squat was better! I think the problem before was that I was going too low.
Practiced a bit in front of a mirror to try to learn where parallel is again.
Need to focus on sitting back, not going too low, big breath, and staying
tight/not bouncing in the hole.

Power cleans were okay. Focused a lot on better starting position (leaning back
and thinking of the arms as strings). Arms still bend a bit, but improved. Next
time, keep it slower off the floor, and keep it close to the chest.

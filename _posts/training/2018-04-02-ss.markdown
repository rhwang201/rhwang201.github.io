### Notes

First day back in a while. Stick a bit sick, sniffles and throat. Lots of energy (mental,
at least). Squats were meh, not the cleanest. Was trying to sit down (knees forward at
beginning of movement), but it was only okay. Wasn't getting back tight enough.
Afterwards, hamstrings really felt tight (guess I haven't used them in a while).

Bench also loose, but relatively easy. Definitely should keep progression conservative
though; this is the route to shoulder injury.

Tried keeping hips high on deads, once again, back wasn't tight enough.

Chins good, lost the "loose pelvis, tight abs" concept I got last time.

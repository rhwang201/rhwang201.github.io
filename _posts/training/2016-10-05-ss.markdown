Squat       :   175x7x3

Press       :   95x12,12,10

Dip         :   45x10,10,7,6

Curl        :   22.5x10x3

### Notes

Didn't get full nights sleep, but not bad. Focusing on squat form, neutral pelvis and
tight abs. Still needs some work.

Press volume, not bad.

Dips whatever.

Incline curls, good pump.

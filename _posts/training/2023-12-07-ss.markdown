Power clean  :  185x2,2,2,1

Dip  :  95x5x3

Chinup  :  25x10,8,8

Pallof press  : 40x19x3

Facepull  : 72.5x13x3

Step downs  :  70x20x3

### Notes

Cleans *way* better. Bar close to the legs, back tight, slow off the floor. Full extension. Go for triples next. Oh, also halting pull + slow pull + clean is a good warmup

Dips hard but good, repeat.

Pallof to 20 reps

### Notes

Pretty good day overall, snatches a bit inconsistent.

Slow pull getting tiring, especially grip.

Drive harder on push press.

Front squats getting better, "chest up" helps stay upright. Stay balanced on foot during
ascent, getting a bit too forward. 

When tired on back squats, "good morning'ing". Keep back tight, ass up.

Narrower grip on OHS, not bad, keep them slow.

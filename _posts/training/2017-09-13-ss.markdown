### Notes

Some deep sleep last night. Been gorging myself recently...I guess I can bulk a bit lol.
Squats not bad, key take-away is to stay tight in the entire trunk, which enables you to
keep back angle constant.

Press good.

Dips easy.

A bunch of hypertrophy stuff, which felt good. Should probably just replace lat pulldowns
with wide-grip pullups.

Also, did BEAR complex. Let's try doing power cleans again.

Bench       :   205x5x4,4

Chinup      :   45x5x5

Back Extension : 0x10x3

### Notes

Not the best recovery this weekend, definitely didn't eat enough. Back is shit. Bench was
pretty weak too, not very fast. Failed last rep.

Chins were good, but hard at the end. Need more speed.

Back extensions for fun.

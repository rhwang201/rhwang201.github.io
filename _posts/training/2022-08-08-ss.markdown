Squat : 225x5x3

Power clean : 180x2x3

Chinup  : 70x5x3

Tricep extension : 42.5x8,8,7

Incline hammer curl : 25x12x3

### Notes

Squats tough, focused on treating lower back well. Good depth and stability in hole, getting out you're good morning-ing a bit. Maybe a bit more volume before progressing?

Not feeling strong for cleans, also star fishing

Bench was taken

Chins easy, probably lost weight

Squat       :   215x5x3

Bench       :   210x5,4,3;205x3x3

Chinup      :   40x5x5

### Notes

Felt great, but apparently was not great. Squat was good actually! No pain from rack.
"Stand up tall" cue helps a lot.

Bench was horrible. Form wasn't bad, a little asymmetric, but just ran out of steam at
end of sets. Not much speed, I suppose.

Chins were fucking awesome.

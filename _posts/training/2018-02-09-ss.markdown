### Notes

Pretty good day. Re-did Monday's weight for squats, felt a lot better. Make sure weight
of bar is fully on upper back/scapulae, especially left side. Chest up, bar path "back",
and neutral pelvis (which helps get the ass back in a good position).

Bench pretty tough. Used the cues "spread the bar" and "bend the bar" during warmups;
they help get to a strong bottom position.

Deads hard, felt like I was engaging lats as hard as usual. Last two reps were alternate
grip.

Stomach upset by chin time, they were pretty easy.

### Notes

Okay day. Stopped looking forward in mirror for squats, starting looking forward and down
at the floor. Seemed to help with positioning. Make sure to keep weight back, on ascent
as well.

Bench was pretty good. Wanted to get a spotter initially, but didn't.

Deads good, alternated last two reps.

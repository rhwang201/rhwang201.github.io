Press       :   105x5x3

Back Extension      :   45x14x5

Facepull    :   45x14x5

### Notes

Pretty damn sleepy this morning. Made a hard dive during volleyball yesterday, so no
squats. Right hamstring should be healed enought for lights squats by Friday.

Shoulders and back tired as fuck. Press went up; also practiced spikes.

Back extensions good.

Might be cheating a bit on facepulls? Easy though.

Squat       :   225x3x3

Press       :   145x1

Chinup      :   75x2

Dip         :   100x1

### Notes

Did some extra work today. Squats were okay, rack could've been better on working sets.
Get weight on back, then tighten upper back. Focused on ass back and balance over
midfoot. Went pretty well.

Lost tightness in torso for press.

Chins were good.

Squat       :   190x5x3

Bench       :   165x5x3

Back Extension  :   10x10x5

### Notes

Wrist still hurts, damn it. Legs freezing from riding this morning, had an adequate
warmup though. Squats not bad. Rack could be better, hips could be set better between
each rep, and you can get angry, though, damn it.

Bench asymmetric. It also irritates wrist. Super weak.

Hip, bridge, goblet

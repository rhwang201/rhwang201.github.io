Snatch :   115x2x3

Push press  : 160x1x3

Front squat   :   220x3x3

Dip      :   85x5,5,4

### Notes

Not a bad day. Snatch better than last time, didn't go for 3 though. More stable overhead, though still not lifting up feet I think.

Push press pretty hard, make sure to brace hard before you dip.

Front squats good, pretty upright, working abs hard.

Dips good, hard

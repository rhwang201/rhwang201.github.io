Squat       :   215x5x3

Press       :   125x5,5,4,3

Dip         :   55x8,8,8,6,5

Curl        :   22.5x8,8,8,6,5

### Notes

A bit fatigued. Squats were ehhh. Really should work on mobility, which I did at the end
of the workout. Weight really is just not back. Do more mobility. Sit in the squat for
a while.

Press was aight, need to keep abs tighter.

Dips were aight, don't be afraid to lean forward and stretch dos pecs.

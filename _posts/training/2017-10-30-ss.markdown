### Notes

Pretty good day, probably could have done more, time permitting. Recovery this weekend
was okay, I suppose. Squats not bad, make sure to sit down.

Press started off really easy, then got hard by last set. Squeeze the bar, don't move
lower body/connection with floor at all.

Power cleans pretty good! Key is to keep scapula down (think "short back").

Dips okay, left shoulder/neck a little tight. Squeeze the bars hard, and big breath.

Curls strong.

Was doing random squat mobility at the end, and it was pretty good.

Squat       :   185x7x3

Bench       :   190x5x5

Chinup      :   35x5x5

Dip         :   25x7x4,5

### Notes

Decently rough weekend of snowboarding up in Tahoe. Legs and glutes got pretty damn
tired, and the right side of my neck got a bit busted up too. Squats were pretty good
though! Rack not bad, mostly balanced in the hole. Nice.

Bench was difficult. Neck made it difficult to get in position.

Chins were whatever.

Dips felt good

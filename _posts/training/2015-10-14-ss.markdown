Squat       :   195x5x3

Bench       :   155x5x5

Chinup      :   10x7x4

### Notes

Fuck. Supposed to be an easy workout, but fucked it up. Squat rack sucked, right
shoulder/elbow really irritated. Didn't even keep trunk fully rigid on all reps.

Bench was whatever, given arm pain.

Chins were pretty good actually.

Friday, I don't care what weight you do, make sure your rack is good.

Power clean  :  190x2x4

Dip  :  100x4x3

Chinup  :  95x3x3

Pallof press  : 40x15x3

Facepull  : 65x18,18,16

Step downs  :  60x14x3

### Notes

Cleans okay. Tried for triples, but failed. If you think long arms, wedge under, arms like strings, your form is way better. Can try to go for trips again?

Reset dips, probably to 90. Risk of injury if too heavy

Back to volume for chins?

Pallofs fine, repeat facepulls, step downs hard

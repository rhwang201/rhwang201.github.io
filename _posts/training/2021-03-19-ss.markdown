### Notes

Still not a great accessory day. Box jumps meh, seem a little timid (using hands). Let's try moving it after pistol/TGU, to warm up a bit

Stopped supersetting TGU and pistols, too hard now. Only got two for last two sets of left side, repeat

Pistols alright, not bad, weight a bit more balanced. Cheated a bit on first set of left side

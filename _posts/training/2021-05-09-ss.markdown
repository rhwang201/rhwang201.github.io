Power clean :   190x3x3

Press   :   125x5,5,4;105x5

Squat   :   235x5x3

Chinup  :   65x5,5,4;45x5

### Notes

Cleans pretty good! Recorded, getting pretty good height. Can practice not shrugging the bar after the knees (keep chest up and long). Repeat

Some progress on press, can give it one more go.

Got squats, but they were tough. Can progress, may need to rethink programming soon.

Stuck on chins again, let's reset

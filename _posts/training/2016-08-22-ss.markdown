Squat       :   225x5x3

Bench       :   200x5x2,4x1,1x1;175x8

Deadlift    :   345x5

Chinup      :   45x5x3

### Notes

Bad recovery this weekend, and definitely tired in the gym, but not a bad day. Squats
aren't bad! Need to be more consistent on rack. Chest up and ass back, but also keep
pelvis under you.

Bench wasn't bad, lack of focus/drive on last rep.

Deads are good, hips are higher now.

Chins good.

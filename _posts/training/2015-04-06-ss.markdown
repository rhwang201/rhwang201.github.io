Chinup      :   25x7,6,5

### Notes

Benched first, and fuck, still missed. First set surprisingly strong, however, spotter
had hover hands, which threw off my form for that set, as well as all subsequent sets.
Fucking sigh. Fatigue gathered quickly, and I missed two reps. Because of slightly wack
form (elbow/shoulder position shifting while bar going up), you should redo this weight.
But fucking nail it next time.

Squat was actually pretty good, kept everything tight. Should try without box soon...

Deads were brutal. Was in a bit of a rush. Video of working set looks legit, but back
does feel slightly suspect. Drop-off set performed with minimal rest, that killed me.

Chins were damn hard after drop-off deads. Was still catching breath, arms dead tired.
I'm thinking weighted bodyweight movements only on heavy days (Monday) from now on.

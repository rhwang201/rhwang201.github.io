Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   180x5x3

Deadlift    :   275x5

Chinup      :   30x5x4,4x1

### Notes

Not a bad day. Not the best recovery this weekend probably. Squat was okay, need to make
sure I'm not squeezing the bar with my hands to keep it in rack. Keep back tight, brace
abs, sit back. Probably 5lb jumps now.

Bench was kind of hard. Need to grip hard and get used to staying tight.

Deads were pretty good. Also need to think about keeping back super tight.

Missed one rep on chins, decent effort on previous sets. Make sure to fully extend at
bottom.

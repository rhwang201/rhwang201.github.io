### Notes

Snatch form a lot better now I think, key insight is that arms will be less vertical when
the bar is above the knees/when the shins are vertical. This keeps the bar close to the
body and lets you get into the power position without rowing as much.

Wrists still a little suspect for clean rack position, so just pulls.

Squats started off meh, but finished better.

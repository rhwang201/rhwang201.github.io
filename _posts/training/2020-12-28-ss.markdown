### Notes

Pretty good day! Cleans were solid, can progress. Have been staying on the midfoot for the second pull, think it's improving my form and getting me to more of a brush than a bang.

Press was good! Big breath, braced abs, chest up, and got these pretty easily

Squats were alright, not sure if my back got loose on some reps. Chest and hips rising at the same pace is a good cue. I can also feel my quads being worked more now in high bar. Can progress, but more slowly now.

Chins good, though barely made last rep. Maybe repeat?

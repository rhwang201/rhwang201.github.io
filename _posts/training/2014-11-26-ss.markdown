Chinup      :   40x7,6,3

### Notes

Squat was hard but okay. Feels significantly slower and like I'm going to stall
soon. Could be a bit tighter at bottom. Also, lean over more for low bar.

Bench was pretty good. Last warmup set felt weak, but at go-time, was strong.
Right shoulder did feel a bit off after, make sure shoulders are nice and
planted. Starting to do 4-rep breath now, it's good.

Cleans were horrendous. Bar swings really far away, couple of atrocious racks.
Reset and learn how to do it properly. I don't know the motion from the knees
to the jumping position. Heck I don't even know the jumping position.

Got greedy on chinups haha. First set was strong. Second, I cheated on the 7th
rep. It was also nearly to failure. Third was obvious a fail.

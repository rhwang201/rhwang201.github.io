Bench       :   175x5x3

Deadlift    :   325x5,225x10(fast)

Chinup      :   25x7,6,4

### Notes

Phew. Today, the drive was there, but strength not quite back. Squats okay, rack seemed
not bad, some pretty good descents into the hole.

Bench was easy, but light. Although...right shoulder would slide a bit during first two
sets, such that the bar would rotate and come closer to my face on the right side.
A proper setup fixed that problem in the third set.

Grip was weak for deads, but overall good. Drop off set reps were _fast_.

Chins were whatever.

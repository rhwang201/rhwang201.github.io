Squat : 200x5x3

Press : 100x5x3

Pullup  : 45x5x3

Dumbbell bench  : 50x12x3

Incline curl  : 27.5x9,9,8

Face pull : 57.5x10x3

### Notes

Pretty good, despite poorer sleep over the weekend

Squats good, felt like good depth/position, upright and mostly over midfoot. Can progress

Press good, think about forearms

Pullups easy, progress by 5lbs

Didn't really get last bench rep

Reset curls?

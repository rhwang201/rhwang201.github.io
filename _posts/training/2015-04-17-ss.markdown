Squat       :   205x5x3

Press       :   135x5x2,4;105x7

### Notes

Only 6 hours of sleep last night, so was pretty tired/low energy. Squat was actualy
pretty good, though, pushed decently hard. Thoracic spine was tight.

Maybe a little ambitious on press. Did a drop off set. Traps were very tired. Also,
obvious sticking point is after the bar passes the head.

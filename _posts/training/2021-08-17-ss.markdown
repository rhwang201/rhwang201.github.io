Snatch :   100x3x3

Overhead squat   :   125x3x3

Dip      :   70x5x3

### Notes

Snatch okay, still "sweeping" the bar into the hips after the knees, rather than opening up. Can progress though.

OHS okay, slow and controlled. Can progress.

Left shoulder iffy on dips, but they were good (tight grip). Can progress, maybe rest the shoulder?

Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   165x5x3

Back Extension  :   25x10x5

Curl        :   22.5x12,12,9,7

### Notes

Okay workout. A little hungry, back super sore from deadlifts. Squats okay, rack still
not consistent, but definitely started off in correct position. Did a couple pauses,
think that's a good idea on light day.

Bench boring, _but_ arms uneven. Left arm a bit higher, might be related to bad rack
during latter squat sets

### Notes

Okay day. A little over-caffeinated at beginning. Squats not bad, focused on not moving
knees at bottom, keeping back tight.

Press pretty good.

Power cleans not good. Height isn't there, so left side of rack is getting injured. Need
to explode and get under the bar.

Forgot if I did three or five sets of dips. They got good after you started squeezing the
bar.

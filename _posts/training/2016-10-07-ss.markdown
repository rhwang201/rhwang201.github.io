Squat       :   185x5x3

Bench       :   185x7x3

Deadlift    :   405x2x2;315x5x2

Chinup      :   45x4x4

### Notes

Squat is okay. Right side of rack is weird, not letting weight sit on shoulder? Fix that.
Sitting in hole not bad...

Bench was pretty good.

Deads were hard, was forward on heavy sets. Fixed it on 315. Chest up, close to legs,
push through heels.

Chins were good.

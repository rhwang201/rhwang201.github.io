### Notes

Pretty good day actually! Found out I'm now 168, down from 174. Squat was pretty good,
main learning is that you have to stay back on ascent as well. Drive bar into rear delts.

Press okay.

Dips good, short rest.

Complex is getting better. Stay more upright on front squats, keep weight back on back
squats.

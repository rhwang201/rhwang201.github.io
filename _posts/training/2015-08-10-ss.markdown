Squat       :   185x5x3

Bench       :   195x5x5

Chinup      :   52.5x5x5

Facepull    :   35x12x3

### Notes

Wow, really weak, back still injured. Squats still uneven. Left hip popped on one rep.
Maybe should still lay off...90-90, hip thrusts, side clams, goblet squat.

Got bench, a little slow.

Chins were hard, also chain belt still irritating back.

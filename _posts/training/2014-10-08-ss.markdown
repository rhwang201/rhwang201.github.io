Chinups:        35x7,5,4

### Notes

Didn't feel fully recovered today. Front squats were tough. Switching to 5lb
jumps was a good idea. Form was pretty good, as usual focus on keeping thoracic
spine tight.

Gah, press. I was a bit nervous (still surprised about hitting last workout's
weight), but the first set felt easy and the second set I powered through.
Fatigue overtook me on the last set though. I'll get it next time.

Deads were easy. Right at the ground, don't smash the bar into your shin. Keep
it on the legs, but not so hard.

Chins regressed a bit I guess because of fatigue.

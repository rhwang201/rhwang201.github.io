### Notes

Squat was meh. Started out okay. Squat rack is pretty stable. Sat down into
hole well most of the time. However, as fatigued accumulated, I became looser
in the hole, and I think I strained my low back a bit. Take a light form day
Friday to reinforce tightness in the hole.

Press was good! Really concentrated on chest up as well as contracted abs.

Deads were good as well! Kept the bar on my legs. Each rep was fast as hell
today. Double overhand was giving out at the end however. Reload on chalk, and
chalk the shit out of the bar.

Dips were strong, but weight was swinging a lot.

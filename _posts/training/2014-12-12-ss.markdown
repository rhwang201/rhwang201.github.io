Squat       :   250x5x3

Bench       :   200x5x3

Chinup      :   40x7,6,4

### Notes

Squats aren't that good. I think it's worth while to reset. On the balls of
feet a lot during ascent. Very slow overall. Varying back angle between reps.

Bench was pretty good! Got a spot on last set and absolutely killed it.

Did chins on the thinner bar. First set was very good.

Squat       :   195x5x3

Bench       :   190x5x3

Deadlift    :   265x5

Chinup      :   45x5x3;0x5

Lateral Raise   :   22.5x10x3

### Notes

Not a bad day. Squats were...not bad. Weight on the back (and a bit on the wrist) before
unracking. Set the back at the top of the movement (chest up, abs crunched). Good job
focusing on hips during movement.

Bench good. Squeeze the bar.

Deads good, although grip weak.

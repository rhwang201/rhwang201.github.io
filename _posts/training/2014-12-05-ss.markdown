Press:          135x5x2,3

Deadlift:       305x5

### Notes

Still quite sick. :/

Squats were hard but not bad. Bar is close to the right position (lower than
you normally would). Weight tends to be on balls of feet now...not good. Also,
I may be hyperextending my lower back when I initiate hip drive (wtf??). Need
to keep a more solid trunk.

I was fatigued as fuck for press. No way.

Deads are aight, had to use alternate grip for last two reps. Maybe hips are
too high in starting position? Also, hips shoot up slightly at beginning.

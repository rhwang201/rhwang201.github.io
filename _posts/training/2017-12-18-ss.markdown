Bench       :   210x4x3;185x7

Deadlift    :   320x5

Chinup      :   45x5x4

Lateral Raise   :   22.5x10x3

Ab wheel    :   0x10x3

### Notes

Not the best recovery this weekend. Squats not bad. Ankle doesn't feel great during
warmups, but not the worst during working set.

Wish I had a spotter for bench, but honestly, wouldn't have gotten 5x3. When tired, need
to focus on making sure bar path is over nipples.

Deads pretty good, can progress weight.

Chins good.

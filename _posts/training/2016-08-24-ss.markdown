Squat       :   230x5x3

Press       :   125x5x2,4x1,1x1

Dip         :   70x5x5

Curl        :   20x10x3

### Notes

Recovery still meh. Got squats, but form creep coming in. Set up rack well on working
sets. Make sure back is tight.

Coulda got press, but wasn't very fire.

Dips are good.

Incline dumbbell curls.

Power clean :   190x3x3

Press   :   127.5x5,4,4

Squat   :   225x5x3

Chinup  :   70x5,4,4

Bulgarian split squat : 40x12x3

### Notes

Power cleans alright, rack not the smoothest. Can probably practice staying over the bar, as opposed to too much forward.

Press okay

Squats fine - tripod, sitting down, triangle up

This time left leg weaker for BSS?

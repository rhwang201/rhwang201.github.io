Squat : 195x5x3

Press  : 117.5x5x3

Pullup  : 65x5x3

Incline dumbbell press : 50x14x3

Incline curl  :  15x15x3

Lateral raise : 10x19x3

### Notes

Was conservative on squats, can probably progress. Knees out a bit, kept everything tight.

Press was solid. Could try progressing.

Just go for it on chins, incline.

Good pump on curls.

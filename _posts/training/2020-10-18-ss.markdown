Power clean :   165x3x3

Press   :   110x5x3

Squat   :   200x5x3

Chinup  :   35x5x3

### Notes

Pretty dead from drinking+run, so overall form not great. Can probably progress but be careful

Cleans alright. Played around with warmups, high pulls, getting on toes. Probably threw off working set a bit, but worth it. Might need to keep the bar closer on second pull.

Press was good, nice job pushing through.

Squats a little unbalanced, latter sets better. Big breath to support the trunk, don't forget, fill it up

Chins good, nicely done

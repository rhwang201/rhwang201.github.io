Squat       :   175x5x3,135x5x2

Bench       :   192.5x5x3

Chinup      :   30x7,7,5,1,1

Back Extension : 45x10x3

### Notes

Squats were up and down. Knee was a bit bruised from volleyball haha. Keep it
low for a while, don't be too aggressive, but really focus on improving form.

Bench was okay, right shoulder still a bit wonky. Not much bounce today, which
is weird...

Got annoyed I didn't get all the chins, the last set was probably 6(?) but I'm
being conservative. Did the last two reps immediately after, got a nice pump.
Let's start ending with a negative.

Started doing back extensions, need to make sure I'm doing them correctly. Also
need to learn how to hold the bar haha.

### Notes

Not a bad day, despite 7 hours and alcohol. Squats pretty good actually! Once knees are
in place, focused on "ass back". Was very tight by third set.

Press was okay, a little loose at bottom.

Power cleans up and down. Keep the bar on the legs, and tighten those lats.

Dips super easy, can bring wrists "in" (medially) a bit more.

Squat       :   220x5x3

Bench       :   185x5x3

Deadlift    :   315x5

Chinup      :   70x4x3

### Notes

Not a bad day actually. Squat form a lot better. Big breath, knees out, sit back,
maintain back angle. Could've had a tighter back.

Bench alright.

Alternate grip on all reps for dead.

Chins easy.

Deadlift  : 350x5

Bench : 185x5x3

Cable row : 140x14,14,13

Dip  :  55x5x3

Hammer curl   : 22.5x12x3

Rear delt cable fly : 12.5x15x3

### Notes

Deads were fine, can progress slowly.

Bench was hard, repeat

Cable rows hard, barely ROM on last reps. Repeat, or go higher intensity

Another 10lb jump for dips

Good pump for last two

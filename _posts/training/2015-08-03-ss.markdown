Back Extension  :   0x20x3

Dip         :   45x7x3

### Notes

Not the best recovery of late, but slept decently well last night. Squat warmup routine
of rolling, 90-90, goblet squat is good. Hip drive was good today.

Press is still weak. Reps were abs were tight were good!

Back extensions good, controlled 1s at top.

Dips were okay, make sure to stay tight.

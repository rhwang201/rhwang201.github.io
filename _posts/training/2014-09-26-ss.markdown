### Notes

Was in a really good mood today at the gym haha, they got new Rogue bumper
plates, and I played Glitch Mob at the end of the workout.

Front squats weren't bad. Be sure to have knees forward, and to stay over the
mid foot. Bench was actually pretty good. Be sure to stay tight at the bottom.
Think of gripping the bar really hard. Power cleans were meh. First of all,
I did the wrong weight. Most sets, one rep would be really good. Need to focus
on setup, keeping the bar on the legs, and a proper rack.

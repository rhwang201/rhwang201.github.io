Squat       :   175x5x3

Bench       :   230x2;135x5

Chinup      :   100x2

Back Extension  :   0x20x3

Facepull    :   25x17x3

### Notes

About 7 hrs sleep, sore throat. No motivation in beginning of workout. Goblet squat to
warm up. Squats weren't bad. Really need to consciously think of breathing, standing up
tall, and setting the pelvis.

Bench was okay, lockup could be more forceful. Need a better, more consistent setup.

Chins were good, not noteworthy.

Back extensions tiring, can add weight now. Supersetted with facepulls.

Anterior hip mobility. Should probably goblet squat more.

Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   180x5x3

Deadlift    :   330x5

Chinup      :   25x6x3

### Notes

Less sleep last night, feeling very tired. Squats okay...Bigger breath, and keep the bar
path a bit more back.

Bench very easy.

Deads good! Also, keep weight a little more back, but good job setting the back nice and
tight.

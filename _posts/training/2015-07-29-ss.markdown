Squat       :   155x5x3

Press       :   115x5x3

Back Extension  :   0x17x3

Dip         :   0x15,15,10

### Notes

Decent sleep, woke up in middle of REM cycle though. Stand tall and neutral pelvis with
breathing has helped a bit. Seems like mobility still a little limiting in hole
though.

Right side of press lags?

Dips getting better. Chest up, neutral neck.

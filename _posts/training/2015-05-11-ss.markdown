Press       :   130x5x4,1;110x5

Squat       :   205x5x3;175x5

Chinup      :   35x5x5,0x8

### Notes

Not the best sleep/nutrition this weekend. Was also hungry this morning, should aim to
eat at least ~400 calories pre-workout. Press was okay; right after it passes my head, my
motion is a bit odd. Be careful with core tightness. I think lower back loosens at
rebound sometimes...Also, really felt abs engaging today (good!).

Squat was pretty good! Widening grip and keeping a neutral neck fixed any shoulder/arm
pain. Pretty even weight over mid-foot, kept back (and lats?) really rigid.

Chins about to get hard.

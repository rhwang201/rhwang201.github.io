Box Jump   :   105cmx3x5

Pistol  :   0x8x3

Turkish Get Up   :   40x3x3

Bench     : 145x6x3

Overhead squat  : 85x3x3

Pullup    : 25x6x3

### Notes

A bit off kilter for box jumps at first, but recovered. Can wind up more during prep

Pistol/TGU superset is tiring. Really brace for the first part of TGU

Bench good, keeping weight over wrist

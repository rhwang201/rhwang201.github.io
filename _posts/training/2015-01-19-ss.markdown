### Notes

Back did not feel good this weekend, so I did a light form day on squat. Meh.
Back angle was more horizontal with low weight. Kept chest up really hard.

Press was pretty good, got it all. Should do 2.5 jumps now though. Kept the
chest up and abs in.

Deads were okay, grip gave out on fifth rep. Back was a little meh. Warmup reps
were awesome.

Started out going too high probably on dips, but caught it. Lower pecs pretty
tired.

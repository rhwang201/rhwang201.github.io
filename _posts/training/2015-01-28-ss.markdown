### Notes

Psyched myself out on the press, I think. Need to make sure my shoulders are
back and down, as opposed to forward. I think the strength is there, just chill
out.

Deads were a bad idea. Take a lower body rest and start just squatting Monday.
Weight wasn't fully on traps, still am not getting full extension on back.

Dips weren't bad, I fixed the odd first rep problem.

Back was tired, only had a ~13 second hold on last rep.

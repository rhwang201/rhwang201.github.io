Squat       :   185x7x3;155x7x3

Bench       :   175x6x3

Deadlift    :   285x5

Pullup      :   35x5x3;0x5x3

### Notes

Bad rest (drinking + sleep), but mostly weak lower back impacting day. Squats alright,
kept them light. Main thing is to move knees forward during top of movement, then _lock
them in place around hole_.

Bench easy, make sure using chest.

Deads alright.

Pullups easy.

Power snatch :   105x3x3

Overhead squat   :   115x3x3

Dip      :   75x5x3


### Notes

Mostly just technique for snatch. Slow pull, pull, snatch (or something along those lines). Trying to eliminate rowing during second pull and open up hip angle/lead with the chest. Pulls look good, but it's not translating over to snatches. Let's keep on working technique, keep it light

OHS hard on upper body, repeat. Knees forward to help with positioning.

Dips good, can progress

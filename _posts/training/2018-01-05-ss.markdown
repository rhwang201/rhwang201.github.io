Squat       :   225x5x3

Bench       :   230x1x3

Deadlift    :   340x5

Chinup      :   90x2x3

Lateral Raise   :   22.5x11x3

### Notes

Low energy day. Squats are not good, went too heavy today. Definitely moving forward in
the hole. Rack was bad, and bottom position was bad. When you feel that warmups aren't
going well, it's okay to stay light and do technique practice. You're not a professional
weightlifter!

Bench okay, being conservative without a spot.

Deads not bad. Be careful with lower back though, maybe take a video to make sure it's
locked.

Chins good.

Lateral raises good.

Snatch :   100x3x3

Push press  : 135x3x3

Front squat   :   205x3x3

Dip      :   75x5x3

### Notes

Wasn't feeling fully recovered at first. Snatches alright, definitely catching high/can get under the bar more quickly. Also noticed you're not lifting up your feet, probably because you're not comfortable with receiving the bar. Can progress, those are things to be aware of/practice

Push press a little harder now, also bruising your right collarbone on re-rack. Maybe progress once more.

Front squats hard, losing back angle and balance more now

Dips hard, but fought through (think about "up" on the way down)

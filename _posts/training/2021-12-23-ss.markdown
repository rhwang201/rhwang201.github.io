Snatch :   110x2x5

Push press  : 147.5x3x3

Front squat   :   220x3x3

Dip      :   80x5,4,4,2

Curl      :   20x12x3

### Notes

No confidence for the snatch, still failing warmups. Worked a bit on less arm row/opening up the hips after the knees, then the third pull, but didn't record. Good height, keep on doing that. Catching high. Go for 3 now?

Push press good, remember to use jerk grip close to palm.

Front squats okay, tripod and chest up, repeat

Dips good, hard. Curls

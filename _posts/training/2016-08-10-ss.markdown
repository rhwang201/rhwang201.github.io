Squat       :   210x5x3

Press       :   125x4x3

Dip         :   55x5x5

Back Extension  :   25x10x5

Curl        :   45x9x5

### Notes

Not a bad day actually, in spite of shitty sleep recently. Squats were solid. Keeping
weight back well. Back is tight too. Just a couple reps in the beginning that are off
sometimes.

Press is a little hard. Focus on good form, namely keeping abs super tight.

Dips easy.

Back extensions fun. As you figured out in later sets, feel free to go a bit faster.
Twenty second hold on last set.

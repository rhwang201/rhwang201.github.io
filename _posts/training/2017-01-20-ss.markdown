Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   215x3x3;135x10x3

Deadlift    :   365x3

Chinup      :   80x3,2,2,1

### Notes

Squats meh, definitely going forward at bottom. Rack is good, getting lats tight. Don't
be afraid to bend over.

Bench was pretty good actually. Got lift-off on last set, reps flew. Did volume at end of
workout.

Back a little tweaked for deads.

Chins top of ROM not great.

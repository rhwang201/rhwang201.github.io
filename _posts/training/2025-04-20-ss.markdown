Squat : 205x5x3

Press  : 122.5x5,5,2

Pullup  : 70x5x3

Incline bench  :  50x15x3

Incline curl  :  15x16x3

Lateral raise  :  10x22x3

### Notes

Press surprisingly weak, but everything else solid. Careful with ligaments/hip on squat.

Progress incline, curl, lateral (weight). Maybe switch it up for pullups?

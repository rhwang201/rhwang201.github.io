Squat       :   225x5;185x5;135x5

Bench       :   180x5x3

Dip         :   0x15x3

### Notes

Meh day. Pretty well rested. Traded squat rack issues with sacrum issues. Left sacrum was
hurting, didn't really squat today. Need to stay over midfoot (think back) and keep trunk
rigid.

Bench was uneven at times.

Dips were good.

Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   175x5x3

Deadlift    :   285x5

Chinup      :   35x5x3

### Notes

Stomach issue over the weekend, so barely ate. Held weight constant. Squats okay, thought
definitely uneven in the hole at times.

Bench okay, touching chest more controlled now ("glass").

Deads easy still, "head back".

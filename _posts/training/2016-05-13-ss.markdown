Bench       :   225x2

Deadlift    :   185x5x3

Dip         :   90x3x4,5x1;45x8x3,7x1

### Notes

Slept late last night for Jai Wolf, but not terribly tired. Bench was okay...didn't push
too hard. Wrist still fuqed up.

Back was feeling iffy, so just did light deads, with long volleyball sessions in between.
Felt better after warming up through volleyball. Remember to push through the heels to
stay balanced (it worked really well).

Dips not bad. AMRAP coulda been better. Also, be careful; might be letting front deltoids
go loose in the hole.

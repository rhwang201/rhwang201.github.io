Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   175x5x3

Deadlift    :   285x5

Pullup      :   25x6x3

Row         :   145x5x3

### Notes

Squats okay, inconsistent. Make sure at the bottom of the movement, there's no knee
movement, ie just hips going down. Be careful with increasing weight.

Close grip for bench, easy.

Squat       :   195x5x3

Press       :   115x5x3

### Notes

Bored day at work, so lunchtime session. Was planning on going hard, but got enticed by
volleyball, hence only two lifts.

Squats were good! Rack is meh, make sure to put it on top of the shelf, don't go too low.
But you were sitting into it well, keeping pelvis in line.

Quick presses, some difficulty with core tightness.

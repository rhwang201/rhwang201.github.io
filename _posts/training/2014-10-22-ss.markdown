Front Squat:    180x5x3

Press:          110x5x3

Deadlifts:      225x5

### Notes

Still feeling weak, not enough calories day before, bad sleep.

Front squat form was pretty good though. Back was more upright, knees more
stable.

Press: right side was lagging on some reps, which is weird. Otherwise, form is
a bit off, need to get the movement back. Grip doesn't feel the same, weight
isn't perfectly over midfoot, not enough lean, not close enough to the face,
not enough movement under the bar.

Deads were good. Less banging into the shins at the bottom. Start position
leaned back until tension.

Squat       :   215x5x3

Bench       :   215x2x3

Deadlift    :   285x5

Chinup      :   100x1x3

Lateral Raise   :   25x8x3

### Notes

Good day. For squats, need to think more "down" than "back", now.

Bench not bad.

Deads pretty good. Figured out "short back" is actually just engaging the lats and
keeping the bar on the legs. Left grip a little weak.

Chins good.

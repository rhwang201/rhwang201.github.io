### Notes

Alright day, a little sleepy. Got squats, but definitely not great. Don't be too eager to
advance. Need to set pelvis and trunk better, and get that stretch reflex.

Press not bad, but ran out of steam.

Power cleans were hard once again. Second set was horrible, need to actually exert some
force lol. Shoulders down during the rack makes for a cleaner unrack. Need more rest in
between sets.

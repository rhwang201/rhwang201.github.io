Squat       :   215x5x3

Press       :   125x5x3

Chinup      :   30x5x5

Situp       :   25x10x3

### Notes

Didn't sleep well last night. Squat rack is slightly better but still bad. Other
mechanics were okay...Still need to be consistently tight. Also weight was forward on
some reps. No pain in trunk though.

Press was a little tough.

Chinups were easy.

Threw in ab work.

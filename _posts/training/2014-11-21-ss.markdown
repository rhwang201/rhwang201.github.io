Bench       :   190x5x3

Squat       :   235x5x3

Chinup      :   35x7,6,5

### Notes

Didn't eat enough for dinner, but slept more than usual for a Thursday haha.

Benched first, cause people were using all the shit. Was pretty good. A little
slow of the chest, maybe should get better at tight bouncing. Next workout
should be good as well.

Squat was not bad. Got pictures of my rack (thanks Tony). It's asymmetric and
not low bar...? Also, my wrists bend forward. Will post in lifting group for
feedback. Most of my focus was directed towards my upper back/arms, but the
squat itself wasn't bad. Pretty tight, probably going too low, but no pain.
Same as bench, should probably start bouncing harder now.

Chinups were whatever, not very strong, not very weak.

### Notes

Not a bad day. Focused on neutral pelvis in the hole for squats. Bar path overall feels
a lot better. Just be sure to keep it back.

Press good on working sets, keep it tight.

Power cleans a lot better now. Still setting up from the top. Once above the knees, keep
the movement to the hips.

Dips easy.

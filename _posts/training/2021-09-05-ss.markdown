Power clean :   190x3x3

Press   :   120x5x3

Squat   :   225x5x3

Chinup  :   70x5,4,4,3

### Notes

Went for it and got it on cleans this time. Probably need some techinque work on extending the pull (as opposed to a drag). Also, maybe want to change programming, ie maybe some doubles.

Press pretty good despite banging my elbow earlier in they day. Also, no shoulder pain!

Squats okay, some left knee pain on warmups. Be careful there.

Reset chins

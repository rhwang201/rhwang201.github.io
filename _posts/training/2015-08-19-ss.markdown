Squat       :   135x5x3

Bench       :   165x5x3

Pullup      :   0x10,9,7

### Notes

Need to eat more. Sleep seems to have been good lately. Good cues to remember for squat
are "stand up straight" and to keep your ass back (while staying over midfoot). The
latter will keep your posterior chain tight and your positiioning solid in the hole.

Bench was whatever, still seem to favor left side?

Pullups whatever.

Did some squat mobility as part of warmup, overhead, goblet, left couch

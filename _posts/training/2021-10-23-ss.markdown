Power clean :   180x3x3

Press   :   120x5,4,4,2

Squat   :   215x5x3

Chinup  :   60x5x3;25x7

### Notes

Not bad. Clean strength is there, mindset and technique aren't (caught one rep during the first set in a full clean). Can progress

Press hard

Knees forward on squats is good, progress

Chins good/easy, progress

Lateral delt raises for the gurlz, 10lbsx12x3

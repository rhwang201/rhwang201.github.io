Facepull    :   45x14x3

### Notes

Good day! Maybe because of coffee haha. Squat, in particular, was good. Rack was perfect
on warmup sets, but could've been better on working sets; right shoulder off a bit.
Tightened back, stayed back on ascent, drove bar into back.

Press good as well. Kept trunk tight, leaned back a bit more.

Back extensions good.

Facepulls good.

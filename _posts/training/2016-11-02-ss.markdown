Squat       :   225x5x3

Press       :   105x7x3

Dip         :   45x10x3

Curl        :   20x10,10,8

### Notes

Okay day. Squat wasn't horrible, was actually okay. Did pauses on first set, then normal
reps on next two. Definitely some asymmetry on right side, also lower back is a bit
tweaked now. On pauses, noticed back angle wasn't keep solid, ass was rising too fast.

Press was easy.

Dips were good.

Curls were good.

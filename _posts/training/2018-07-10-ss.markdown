Squat       :   175x5x3

Bench       :   185x5x3

Deadlift    :   235x5

Chinup      :   45x5x4

Lateral Raise   :   22.5x12x3

### Notes

Been sick since last workout. Squats were meh, should maybe work on mobility. Feels like
torso is limiting legs' ability to do work.

Bench pretty good, squeezed the bar.

Squat:      165x5x3

Press:      95x5x3

Deadlift:   185x5x2

### Notes

First day working out at Pacific Shores Center. Also, first time training in
almost two months. Facility surprisingly has a Rogue rack, olympic
weightlifting bar, bumper plates, and chalk in the back.

Everything felt moderately unfamiliar as expected. Squat form got better in
later sets, press was pretty easy although I bruised my collarbone, and
deadlift was easy as well. Remember to take slow progress.

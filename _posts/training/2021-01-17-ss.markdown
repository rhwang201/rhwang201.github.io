Power clean :   180x3x5

Press   :   120x5x3

Squat   :   210x5x3

Chinup  :   60x5,5,3

### Notes

Felt fatigued, couldn't tell if poor sleep or general. Cleans definitely harder, had one rep that you received pretty low. Overall, not bad though, focused on staying over the bar at the knees and keeping bar close (upper thighs and during extension)

Great job on press today, tight and strong!

Squats alright, legs were definitely a bit fatigued. Starting to feel in core (lower back and abs). Can progress

Rushed for chins, last set was more like 2.5. First two sets strong though

Snatch :   105x3x3

Push press  : 147.5x2x5

Front squat   :   215x3x3

Dip      :   70x5x3

### Notes

Not great sleep. Snatch warmups were bad, but working sets not bad. Still catching high of course. Can work on initiating second pull right after the knees, and pulling under faster and lower

Push press was variable but not bad. The jerk grip was a revelation

Front squats okay, back angle not perfect. Can probably repeat

Reset dips, ez

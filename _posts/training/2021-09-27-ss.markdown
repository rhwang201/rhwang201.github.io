Snatch :   105x3x3

Push press  : 130x3x3

Front squat   :   185x3x3

Dip      :   75x5,5,4

### Notes

Snatch fine, good height, probably rowing though didn't record. Overhead position strong though. Maybe progress with doubles?

Push press okay, getting more used to jerk rack. Progress.

Front squats good, mostly technical. Last 10lb increase?

Good effort on dips

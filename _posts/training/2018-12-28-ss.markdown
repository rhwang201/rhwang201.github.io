Squat       :   215x5x3

Press       :   135x3x3

Power Clean :   165x3x4

Dip         :   110x2x3


### Notes

Not a bad day. Squat rack better. Make sure "heels aren't externally rotating". Relaxed
neck.

Press good.

Cleans alright. Last rep of each set going into full clean...Good job shoulders back.
Also, started maintaining tightness ("chest up") throughout movement, ie getting rid of
jerk movement before jump.

Dips good, stayed tight on last one.

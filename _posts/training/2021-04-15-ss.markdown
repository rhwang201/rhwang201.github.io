Snatch  :   Technique at 95, 105

Pullup    : 25x7x3

Squat   :   185x5x3

Box Jump   :   105cmx3x5

Dip     : 55x7,7,5


### Notes

Snatch practice, kind of random complexes of pulls, high-pulls, power cleans. Pretty good actually, got practice at getting tight in the setup

I _think_ I got all the pullups?

Squats were good, 3 pauses, 2 normal. Good tightness, focusing on an open and upright chest

Box jumps better, only kind of using your right hand for stability. One more time?

Dips good, pretty hard

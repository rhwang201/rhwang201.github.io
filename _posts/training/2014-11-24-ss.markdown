### Notes

Woke up at 530 this morning, felt not too bad.

Squat rack is much improved. Moved it down, under the traps and on top of rear
delts. Need to stay more balanced over mid foot, but overall not bad.

Press was hard, but got it. Leaned back more, which really helped getting up
off the bottom. Last rep was a complete grinder, but got it.

Deads were good! Still have the scab. Think weight is more on traps now, which
is good.

Dips were hard, triceps were super pumped.

Squat       :   195x5x3

Press       :   105x5x3

Back Extension  :   25x12x3

Face pull   :   35x15x3

### Notes

Eh squat. Maybe a couple good reps where hips really tight. Those reps are always so
_nice_ out of the hole. Rack not perfect. A little loose in hole.

Press was casual, kept trunk tight the entire time. Widened grip a bit.

Back extensions feel good.

Practiced volleyball spikes a bit, left and right arm.

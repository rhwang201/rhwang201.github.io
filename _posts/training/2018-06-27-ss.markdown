### Notes

Pretty chill day. Lower back and sacrum still don't feel great from Monday, that means
you weren't ready for 225 squat. Squats not bad today, good job leaning over, getting in
the hole. Make sure everything is set at the top _before_ you begin the movement.

Press was easy. Brace the abs.

Power cleans not bad. The fact that there is slight bruising under the knee is probably
indicative of some bad form.

Dip         :   80x5x3;60x6

### Notes

Spicy pork intestine wrecked my digestive system, so kind of a rushed day. Squats are
a pretty hard now. Remember to neutrally-set your pelvis before each rep, it helps with
reaching a good bottom position.

Press was really easy, despite shoulders feeling dead on warmups.

Cleans are meh, probably too heavy. The lighter sets were good, in that the rack felt
like "less distance".

Dips good.

Deadlift  : 325x5

Bench : 165x9x3

Cable row : 160x14x3

Lateral raise : 10x15x3

Hammer curls  : 25x10x3

Tricep pushdown : 30x16,16,20

### Notes

Deads good, back tight, bar path felt solid. Can do another 10lb increase

Everything else fine, did dropoff sets. Repeat cable rows. Barely made last lateral raise reps, but good pump.

Used different attachment for tricep pushdowns, so easier

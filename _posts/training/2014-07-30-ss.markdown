Deadlift:       225x5 

Chinups

### Notes

Not a good workout. Squats felt worse than expected; in fact everything felt
weak. I think the issue with the squats is the lower back/pelvis issue. Pretty
sure there must be an unacceptable amount of lumbar movement in the hole.
Planning on taking Friday off from squatting.

Pressed sucked too. Was supposed to do 115, 110 didn't even feel good. From
recent squat and press history, it feels like I have no core strength...

Deadlift was whatever. Pretty easy, not the best form.

Get a video of your squat ASAP. Stop wasting time.

Snatch  : 100x3x3

Pullup  : 55x5x3

Squat :   215x5x3

Dip     :  60x7x3

Box Jump   :   107cmx3x3

### Notes

Poor recovery again. Snatches not great, failing on receive again. Really need to get bottom position strong. Slow and controlled pulls as part of warmup were nice though

Pullups good, last rep probably not there so repeat.

Pause squats alright, could advance or switch it up.

Dips strong. Maybe miscounted last rep. Can progress

Used pads for box jumps a lot better. Repeat once more

### Notes

Power snatch seems fine. Rowing, but when you put the gas on it, feels not bad.

Don't know what happened with cleans...Think you're losing confidence doing heavy lifts
at home. Should do some sort of weekly programming.

Nice to get the bar into the hips with the snatch pulls.

Push press fine.

Squats fine, just put more effort, get tight, bounce.

Third set of OHS hard.

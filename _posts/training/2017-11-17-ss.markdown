### Notes

Pretty good day, despite drinking last night, being over-caffeinated, and an upset
stomach haha. Squat not bad; keep the chest up, shoulders down and relaxed, and back
tight.

Press good! Get under the bar fast.

Power cleans pretty good. Pull off the floor (chest up, shoulders down and relaxed, lats
tight), before exploding. Aim a bit higher on the legs (a couple warmup reps were a good
height).

Dips easy. Going slowly as well (in control).

Curls super easy.

Second and third set of knee tucks were tiring.

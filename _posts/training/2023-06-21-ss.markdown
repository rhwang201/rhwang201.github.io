Deadlift  : 345x5

Bench : 155x11,11,9

Cable row : 140x16x3

Tricep extension : 30x12x3

Incline curls  : 22.5x13,10,7

Rear delt cable fly : 10x15x3

### Notes

Still a bit sick, nauseous at the end.

Deads alright actually. Back was tight, lats "short". Progress slowly.

Good pump on bench, rows were hard

Good form on rear delt flies, focus on moving the humerus

### Notes

Good day! Slept a lot the night before (exhausted from dance), ate a surplus some days,
deficit others. Squat pretty good actually. Remember to concentrate on pelvis (lower
back) to stay stable in the hole. (There were some reps where you were loosey goosey with
pelvis). Keep on looking at the floor some distance ahead, and think about not moving
knees.

Press good, easy. Thought about keeping abs tight even when moving under bar.

Power cleans a lot better (also was a lot less tired during them today). Focused on the
second pull (pelvis moving forward), and did the movement more starting from the bottom.

Dips alright, not very focused, but pushed through last rep.

Squat       :   185x5x3

Bench       :   175x5x3

Deadlift    :   245x5

Chinup      :   35x5x4

Lateral Raise   :   22.5x10x3

### Notes

First day back in a while. Squats alright, weight could be a bit more forward at top of
movement. Think "ass up" during the entire ascent.

Bench easy after first set. Good bar path.

Deads pretty good. Once bar touches shin, chest up and tighten lats. Then, push through
heels.

### Notes

Snatch alright, think I want to try getting the shins more vertical. Also, still working 
on a good power position (torso upright, shoulder back, bar in hips)

Cleans actually look great, but getting too nervous with heavy weights indoors. Can feel
that you are staying over the bar, and second pull feels good.

Not aggressive on press, need to start bounching more.

Squats felt heavy. Video looked not bad to be honest, but probably got psyched out from
cleans. Probably need to switch up programming (front squats on weds?).

Tweaked knee a bit on OHS.

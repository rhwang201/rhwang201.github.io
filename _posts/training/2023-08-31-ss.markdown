Power clean  :  175x3x3

Press : 125x5,4,4

Pullup  :  25x8x3

Lateral raise : 17.5x14x3

Pallof press  : 50x14x3

Facepull  : 57.5x16x3

### Notes

Finally good sleep.

Cleans not bad, can progress. Try to not star fish

Press hard. Pullups, lateral raise easy. Pallof hard.

Can probably stop cutting and go into maintenance/slight surplus soon

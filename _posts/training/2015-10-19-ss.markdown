Squat       :   245x5x3

Bench       :   195x5x5;155x5

Chinup      :   22.5x5x5

Back Extension  :   0x20x3

### Notes

Not a bad workout. Squats were okay, no pain. Felt pretty heavy though. Reps were good
when I was looking pretty forward (at the ground ~15ft away?). Lumbar/pelvis can be set
a bit harder though.

Bench was ehh. Shoulder/elbows not perfect. Last rep spotter actually helped a bit. Reps
weren't even and occasionally near throat.

Chins were kinda hard.

Back extensions for the pump.

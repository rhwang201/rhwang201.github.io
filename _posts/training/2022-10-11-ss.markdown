Bench : 145x9x3

Deadlift  : 315x5x3

Chinup  : 45x6,6,4

High-to-low : 65x14x3

Hammer curl : 25x10x3

Lateral dumbbell raise  : 17.5x13,10,10

### Notes

Bench pump felt good, also shoulder still pretty good. Decent bounce and control.

Deads a little tiring. Keep arms long to not shrug traps.

Everything else was a bit hard

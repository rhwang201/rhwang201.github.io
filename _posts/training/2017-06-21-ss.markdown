### Notes

Light day. Squats pretty good actually. Focused on bar on rear delts on ascent, sitting
back. Actually felt glutes/hamstrings engaging, which is good! Keep it light, get the
form down.

Bench whatever.

Don't think chest is up enough on deadlifts

Did BEAR complex, killed me.

Rowed for cardio at end.

Hip flexor stretch

Deadlift  : 315x5x3

Bench : 170x5x3

Chinup  : 65x5,5,4

Cable crossover : 37x13x3

Incline hammer curl : 25x10,10,9

Incline dumbbell bench  : 35x12x3

### Notes

Deads still getting harder. Maybe add volume now.

Bench also hard, can add volume

Did chins right after deads, maybe that's why they were hard

Focused more on contraction for hammer curls, think that was good

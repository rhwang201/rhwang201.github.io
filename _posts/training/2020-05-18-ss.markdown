Power clean from knees  :   150x3x3

Snatch pull   :   135x3x3

Push Press  :   140x3x3

Squat   :   225x5x3

OHS     :   75x3x3

Chinup  :   60x5,5,3


### Notes

Oly solid, no more ball-hitting. Focused on getting a straight bar path for snatch,
"elbows up". Also, overall continue to drive even after contact.

Snatch pull pretty good, though contact seems soft?

Push press good.

Squat felt heavy at first (maybe didn't warm up enough), but overall not bad. Not sure
whether to do light day, or slow progression.

OHS harder

Tired for chins.

Squat   :   215x5x3

Press   :   145x2x3

Facepull    :   90x15x3

Curl    :   20x10x3

### Notes

Pretty good day actually. Recovery hasn't been good, bad sleep, not eating enough. Squats
work out well sometimes when I go heavier, maybe because then I _have_ to stay tight.
Trying to keep back tight, thinking about driving pelvis up.

Press was pretty good.

Dips were solid.

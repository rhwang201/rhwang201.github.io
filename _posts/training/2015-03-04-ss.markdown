Squat       :   195x5x5

Bench       :   175x5x3

Deadlift    :   285x5x3

### Notes

Squats sucked today. Maybe it is because of the intense volleyball game
yesterday, but I'm still tight and limited especially in the hole. I had right
hip pain. To top it off, my rack is off (right anterior shoulder has some odd
tightness?). Welcome elbow pain and forearm tightness. Should drop for next
workout and ensure form is okay. Do some mob work at home.

Bench felt terrible because of squat rack, but at least got it up.

Deads were good. Grip is giving out on later sets. Did ~10s hold on last set.
Can start doing single work set soon.

Squat mob.

Clean : 175x2x5

Overhead Squat  : 125x3x3

Pistol  : 0x6x3

Dip   : 55x6x3

Box jump  : 109cmx1x3

### Notes

Clean practice, meh. Front squats are weak, also a bit fatigued overall

OHS started strong, lost a bit of balance on some reps. Progress?

Pistols better

Missed all the box jumps (3 pads)

Clean : 155x2x5

Snatch :   95x1x5

Dip   : 45x7x3

Pistol  : 0x5x3

Box jump  : 109cmx2x3

### Notes

Full clean practice. Not bad, just weak front squat obviously. Also, finding your balance on receiving.

Overhead position tired for snatch. Good height as always, just still need to grease the groove for receiving.

Dips fine

Pistols fine, it's okay to lean forward more on your right leg. Threw in a pause on last rep

Didn't really get that many box jumps. Three pads

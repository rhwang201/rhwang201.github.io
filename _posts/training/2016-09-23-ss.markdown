Squat       :   185x5x5

Bench       :   195x7,7,6;165x9

Deadlift    :   365x5;315x5x2

Chinup      :   35x5,4,4

### Notes

Fun workout. Squats still really aren't there, should've gone a bit lighter. Really think
about the pelvis, and not moving the knees at all in the hole.

Bench was pretty good.

Deads were solid, but keep the bar on your legs.

Grip/lats were gone for chins.

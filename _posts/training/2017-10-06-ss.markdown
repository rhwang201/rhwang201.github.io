Curl        :   27.5x7,7,6

### Notes

Squat okay. Doing neutral foot now. Bar could maybe be a little higher on back. Keep
midsection a bit tighter.

Press pretty good! Not enough in the tank for more than one rep, but they weren't too
hard.

Power cleans could use improvement. Bar ending up forward in rack. Also, squeeze more
slowly off the floor, only accelerate near top of thighs.

Dip was okay.

Pullups were good.

Squat       :   220x5x3

Bench       :   190x5x3

Deadlift    :   330x5

Chinup      :   60x5x3;45x5

### Notes

Good day. Been "IF"ing recently. Squats were better. Knees out, knees immobile.

Bench was good. Held breath for 4 reps. Keep it "low".

Deads good. Feels like low back is rounding, which means just barely.

Chins really easy.

Front squat : 195x5x3

Pendlay row : 155x8x3

Deadlift  : 305x5x3

Lat pulldown  : 60x10x3

Tricep extension  : 42.5x8,6,6

Curl  : 60x9x3

### Notes

Careful with squats, lower back a bit tweaked. Probably take Friday light

Rows fine.

Deads fine, easy even, though forgot chaltk

Probably too much volume on tri's now (doing it every workout day)

Some light presses (65lb), shoulders really weak lol

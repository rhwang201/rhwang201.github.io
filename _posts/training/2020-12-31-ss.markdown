Power snatch :   105x3,3,2

Bench   :   170x5x3

Squat   :   200x5x3

Dip     :   65x5x3

### Notes

Fatigued from skiing. Snatch form is meh, I bet the second pull looks sloppy and has some arm bend. Didn't rack the last rep. Redo, obviously.

Bench was fine, can probably progress again.

Squats okay, some uneven chest/hip rising ratio. Two times at a weight now.

Dips rushed, hard, and fine

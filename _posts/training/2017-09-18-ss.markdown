### Notes

Good day. Slept early, ate a heartier breakfast, had some cold-brew coffee. Squats
alright, continue focusing on keeping trunk tight in hole. Continue doing mobility to
help getting in hole.

Good job on press. Abs tight.

Threw in some power cleans again. Saw in videos the rowing motion after bar crosses
knees. Think of arms as strings, don't be too aggressive with weight until fixed.

Good job on dips!

Pullups for lat hypertrophy.

Curls easy.

Forgot facepulls. Some misc mobility thrown in between sets (pigeon, squats, pec
stretch).

### Notes

Oly pretty good, slow full movement actually looks alright (recorded video).

Slow pull better, keep shoulders slightly in front of bar.

Arms weak for press.

Squat was suspect at first, but not bad. A bit of butt wink (vid).

Remember to throw in some OHS at the end to work on mobility.

### Notes

Pretty good day actually. Went snow camping/backcountry skiing over the weekend, woke up
very stiff and fatigued. Squats actually not bad. Sitting "down", and actually leant over
a bit more today. Kept bar "back", over midfoot.

Press good. Worked hard to keep abs tight, squeeze the bar, and keep it over midfoot.

Cleans _seem_ better...Starting position is indeed a bit more forward. Weight should be
on balls of the feet. Should feel more quad-heavy. Accelerated once past the knees, and
jumped straight up.

Dips pretty good. Getting more of a "forward" stretch on anterior delts.

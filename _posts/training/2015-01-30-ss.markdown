Bench       :   197.5x5x3

Chinup      :   30x7,7,6,1

Back Extension : 25x10x5

### Notes

Bench was okay. First set, really uneven, skewed towards the right. _Need to
work on right anterior shoulder mobility_. Second and third sets were much more
even and had better bounce. Soon, let's switch to intermediate programming for
presses.

Gah, didn't get chins again. Too fatigued. Next time, switch it up and do
lighter pullups.

Back extensions were okay, did 10 second hold on everything, and then 20 second
hold on the last set.

Snatch :   105x3x3

Push press  : 140x3x3

Front squat   :   210x3x3

Dip      :   80x5,4,3

### Notes

Snatch height good as always, receive not bad, think about pushing "up" on the bar. Can progress

Push press not bad, make sure to "draw out" the push. Can progress again

Front squat tough again, maybe repeat?

### Notes

Still rowing on snatch...Noticed on cleans you get lower leg more vertical, maybe
something similar for snatch?

Cleans fine.

Snatch pulls fine, experimented with a bit longer "pushing against the floor".

Press first set was good, not enough stamina.

Squats were good-ish. A bit on toes for later reps.

OHS all over the place

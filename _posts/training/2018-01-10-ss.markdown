### Notes

Okay day, not a ton of sleep last night, also bowel timing has changed lol. Squats
alright. During drop off set, focused on not moving the knees after a certain point in
the descent, which was helpful.

Bench was easy, focused on leaving fingerprints in the bar.

Deadlift was eh. Recorded it, back definitely undergoes a bit of flexion during the
movement. Reset the weight a bit.

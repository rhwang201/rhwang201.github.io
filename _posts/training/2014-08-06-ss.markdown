Bench:      160x5x3

Power Clean:   135x5x3

### Notes

Took a break again from squatting, really should be more careful.

Bench was pretty easy, work more on keeping it even. Oh, and there was a weird
pain in the palm of my hand near lockout.

Power clean was okay. Focus on catching in less of a squat, aiming high, and
keeping it close to the chest.

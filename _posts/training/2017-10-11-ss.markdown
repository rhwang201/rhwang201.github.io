### Notes

Hella tired this morning. Getting a little chubby around the midsection haha. Back not
feeling great, so did a light day for squats. Not bad, kept shoulders down and relaxed,
tried to stay over mid-foot rather than too far back. Helped with keeping tight on the
last two sets.

Press was very easy.

Power cleans are meh. Make sure to squeeze the bar off the floor and keep the lower part
of the movement controlled and slow. Chest up during setup, keep arms straight, explode,
and get under bar. Rack is no longer forward, which is good, but need to get bar up
higher (or get under it faster).

Dip super easy, did them explosively (kind of).

Pullups good.

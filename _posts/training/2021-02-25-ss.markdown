Pistol  :   0x7x3

Turkish Get Up   :   45x3,3,2

Box Jump   :   115cmx3x4

Overhead squat  : 95x3x3

Dip       : 40x6x2

Pullup    : 35x6x2

### Notes

Pistols getting better, though right is definitely weaker

Failed last rep during descent for left side, can repeat

Box jump alright, first two sets probably a bit less than 115, second two maybe 116

Overhead squats not bad, make sure to keep weight over whole foot (going too much to balls of feet). Practiced dropping bar into back rack as well. Can probably progress

Supersetted dips/pullups, couldn't finish

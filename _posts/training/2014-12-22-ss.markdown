Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   205x5x3

Chinup      :   40x7,6,2

### Notes

Kept squats light. Short rest, they were okay. Main thing is to stay
disciplined when you get heavy.

Hit bench again! Had a spotter on all three sets. Remember to squeeze the bar,
push through your lower body, and keep it even.

Tired for chins.

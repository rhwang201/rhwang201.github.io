### Notes

Meh day. Squats were pretty good. Rack is still meh, but better than last time. Focused
on "leaning over" more, helps with staying tight.

Press was strong. All the doubles were super easy.

Cleans were not good. Weight was obviously too heavy, could barely get into rack. Lower
the weight.

Dips were good, but shoulder/elbow weren't great from squats/cleans.

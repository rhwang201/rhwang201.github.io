Squat       :   210x5x3

Bench       :   210x3,3,2

Deadlift    :   315x5;225x5

Chinup      :   75x3,3,2

Farmers Walk    :   50, three walks around back room

Cable Crunch    :   100x6x3

### Notes

Pretty good day. Squats not bad, think "hollow" position, and ass back.

Bench okay, need to be more aggressive/faster.

Lower back does not feel good on deadlifts.

Not used to heavy chinups yet (as opposed to neutral grip).

Grip gets tired on farmer's walk.

Have no idea how ot do cable crunches lol.

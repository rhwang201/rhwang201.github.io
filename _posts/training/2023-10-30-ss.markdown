Deadlift  :  345x5

Bench : 170x7x3

Cable row : 170x7,9,9,2

Tricep extension  :  30x15,15,11

Lateral raise  :  22.5x11x3

Neck extension  :  10x18x3

### Notes

Deads pretty good... Maybe another 10lb increase...?

Bench good, messed up reps on rows, tri's hard

Lateral raise pretty good actually, front neck hard (progress?)

55lb x 45s isometrics, add 5lbs

Squat       :   165x5x3

Bench       :   220x3

Chinup      :   55x5x3

### Notes

In care of strained back, I practiced pause squats today, which I'm optimistic will
really help my squat. Did a bunch of sets with 135. Also practiced setting trunk; chest
up, big breath, lats tight.

Bench form sucks. Weird forearm sensation, might be the result of weight not fully
resting in foot of palm. Also did some pauses, which are helpful. Bench obviously is not
back at peak strength yet.

Chins were good! Reps flew, after second set, I wanted to go for five reps haha.

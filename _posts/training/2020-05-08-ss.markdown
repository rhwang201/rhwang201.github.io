### Notes

Pretty good day. Filming the lifts is helping a lot. Make sure back is tight to get rid
of premature shrugs. Probably one more week at most from the knees before from the floor.

Noticed having a little valgus knee just out of hole, keep that pushed out. Still getting
bit used to shoes, re: knee position.

OHS a lot easier now...

Squat       :   225x5x3

Press       :   145x2,2,1

Dip         :   100x2x3

Facepull    :   110x15x4

Curl        :   22.5x8x3

### Notes

Hm. Working set squats could be better. Still losing tension at the bottom, be careful
with left knee. Good job on feeling weight on upper back on ascents though.

Press whatever.

Dips whatever.

Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   190x5x5;165x10

Dip         :   45x7x2,5x1;25x7

### Notes

Still presumably sick, and tired, but not a bad day. Squats are okay, rack seems to be
mediocre. Varying degrees of being balanced in hole.

Bench not bad. Right anterior shoulder was really tight on warmups, but was fine on
working sets. Everything was pretty slow, so had to push hard. Got a pump going from drop
off set.

Dip volume.

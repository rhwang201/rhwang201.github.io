### Notes

Okay day. Bad recovery this weekend, started off the workout stiff and sleepy. Squats not
bad, but weight needs to be back more.

Press was okay, abs tightness was pretty good at times. Keep bar close to you.

Power cleans alright. Keep grip narrow, bar close to leg (chest up at the bottom to
remove slack from arms), get into jumping position.

Dips meh, need to keep weight further back.

Face pull : 49.5x12x3

Pallof press  : 27.5x11x3

### Notes

12x3x30 cardio

Also learned inverted kettlebell press, plus prone lateral raise. Probably can spread shoulder rehab exercises across multiple days

Did mobility (rolling, ankle, sun salutation), feels good.

Probably want to get this basic equipment for doing at home in SF

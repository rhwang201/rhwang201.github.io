Squat       :   185x8x3

Bench       :   155x9,9,10,10

Deadlift    :   355x5

Chinup      :   35x5x5

### Notes

Sleepy. Squats are okay...sitting back better, for form still isn't great.  Stay light,
stay tight.

Bench was too easy.

Deads were good. Push through heel, squeezed off the floor.

Chins were good.

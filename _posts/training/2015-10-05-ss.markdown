### Notes

Happy about this workout actually. I didn't read all the way until getting off the
shuttle, which today let me focus and prepare a bit for the workout. Squat wasn't that
good, could still stay more rigid over mid foot. Back didn't feel extremely tight either.
Probably only do two heavy squat days a week now.

Bench was alright. Should keep bar a little lower on body.

Wrist can handle neutral grip chinups!!

External rotator mobility. Nice cold shower.

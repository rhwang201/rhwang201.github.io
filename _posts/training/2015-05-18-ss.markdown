### Notes

Man, recovery this weekend _sucked_ (but the fun was worth it haha). Squats were okay.
Last set was pretty good. Weight was on mid-foot (have to think about heels). *Lats* and
back were tight. Took a big breath and set before each rep.

Bench was hard, pretty fast and pushed hard, but missed last rep (didn't unleash).
Punishment set was good. Make sure to keep the bar low (nipples).

Deadlift warmup reps were awesome. Stay a bit tighter on working set. Was pretty blasted
by this point, as I was rushing to make work.

Blasted for chins too. Gah.

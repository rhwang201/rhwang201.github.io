Squat       :   215x5x3

Press       :   125x5x3,4x2

Deadlift    :   285x5

### Notes

Meh. Still feeling tired. First two squat reps sucked, couldn't keep tight. Last set,
back angle was solid.

Press was weak, back felt strained, weak abs? Lockout was pretty weak too. 2.5lb jumps
after this.

Deads were better.

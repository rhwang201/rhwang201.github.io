Squat       :   185x5x4

Bench       :   190x5x3

Chinup      :   30x7,7,6

### Notes

Did light squats, but to not much avail. I'm sitting in the hole all wrong,
specifically, my back relaxes and rounds. Did some sets at 185, 135, 95 to try
to get the form back...

Bench was okay. I treated it perhaps a bit casually.

Chinps were okay, I got somewhat pumped for them.

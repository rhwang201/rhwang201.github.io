Squat       :   215x5;185x5x3

Bench       :   185x7x3

Deadlift    :   365x4,1

Chinup      :   25x6x3,15x6x2

### Notes

Tired. Squats suck, not sitting in hole correctly, need to reset and correct form.

Bench was actually okay, just needed a good spotter.

Wow, can't remember the last time I failed deads. Need to keep the bar on the legs.

Chins were aight.

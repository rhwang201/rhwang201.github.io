Power clean :   195x3x3

Press   :   125x5,4,4,3

Squat   :   240x5,5,4

Chinup  :   60x5x3

Back Extension  : 45x10x3

### Notes

Cleans pretty good! A bit forward on some receives, but overall good height. Thinking about keeping bar close to the body during second pull. Can repeat

Shoulder still a bit sore for press, but really I think your core is too weak (lower back?). Reset, and try getting some volume in, ie backoff sets

Squats okay, good morning'ing at the end of sets a bit. Also using a bit more speed/bounce on later reps. Think you can repeat and get it

Chins fine

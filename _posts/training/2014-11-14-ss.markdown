### Notes

Overall a hard day.

Some really good squat reps. In general, don't be afraid to sit back more, stay
on the midfoot, and lean over.

Press was okay. Got tired on last reps very often. Not moving under the bar
enough, so sticking point is right after it passes the head.

Deadlift was okay. On working set, weight is still not fully on traps.

Dips were surprising easy when I 'sat back' more.

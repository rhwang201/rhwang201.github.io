Squat       :   235x5x3

Press       :   140x3x3

Deadlift    :   390x5

Chinup      :   65x3x3

### Notes

Squat sucked. fuck, you fucktard. Warmups could probably be considered as having been
rushed. Weight not even over midfoot, quads felt a lot of work. Strained lower left right
back.

Press was easy. Trunk tightness was pretty damn good.

Deads felt slow, and back felt in flexion, but video looked awesome. Maybe look a bit
further away.

Chins weren't noteworthy.

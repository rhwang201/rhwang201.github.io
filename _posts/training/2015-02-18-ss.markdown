Squat       :   185x5x5

Press       :   125x5x5

Deadlift    :   225x5x3

### Notes

God, first training session in five days after Mardi Gras. Terribly immobile.
Had difficulty keeping tightness in back. Pulled forward at bottom of squat,
needed to actively think about sitting back. There was a really good rep,
though, were I was tight in the posterior chain all the way through the lift.

Press was harder than expected...Triceps got pretty burnt. Hopefully five pound
jumps will work.

Regressed on arms in the deadlift.

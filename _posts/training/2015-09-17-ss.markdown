Squat       :   195x5x3

Press       :   135x3

Deadlift    :   265x5

### Notes

Not bad, despite quick turnaround time. A little hungry, a little tired, but not too bad.
Squat was okay. Rack is definitely uneven, hence why the plates on the right side always
end up a bit slid towards the end. First set was strong. Ass back cue helped.

Press was stronger than expected. Didn't push myself too much, as I didn't have
a specific goal though...

Deads good, make sure weight on traps, bar close enough, push through heels.

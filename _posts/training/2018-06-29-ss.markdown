Squat       :   205x6x4

Bench       :   186x6x4

Deadlift    :   225x5x3

Chinup      :   90x2,1,1

Lateral Raise   :   25x9x3

### Notes

Alright day. Back still not perfect. Squats were okay, need to make sure the bar is back
in the hole and during ascent, otherwise form is compromised.

Bench pretty good, squeezed the bar tight, held breath for five reps usually.

Deads good.

Power clean :   170x3x5

Press   :   115x5,4,4,3

Squat   :   185x5x3;135x7

Chinup  :   45x5x3

### Notes

Cleans hard, but not bad. Tight back, stay over the bar, stay on midfoot. Repeat once before progressing

Press not bad. Grip a bit too wide. Big breath, brace abs

Squats good, keeping knees forward/avoiding excessive "knees out" removed the pain in right knee

Chins easy

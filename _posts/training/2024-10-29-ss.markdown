Deadlift  :  340x5

Bench : 175x5; 180x5,4

Cable row : 130x11,11,10

Tricep extension  :  35x13,13,10

Lateral raise  :  15x20x3

Neck extension  :  25x15,15,12

### Notes

Deads fine. Messed up weights on first bench set, then it was kidna hard. So maybe 175.

Everything else.

Good reset on lateral raises

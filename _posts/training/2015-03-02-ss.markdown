Squat       :   185x5x5

Press       :   130x5x5

Chinup      :   0x12,8,6

### Notes

Did not recover well this weekend for squats, both sleep and playing football.
Pretty tight. Strength was there, but mobility a bit low...so got pulled
forward a bit in bottom.

Press was good! Breezed through first three sets easily, then got distracted by
a cute girl...lol. Totally psyched myself out on the last set, but got it!

Was pretty pumped for chins, but good work.

Couch stretch.

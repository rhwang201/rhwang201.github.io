Squat       :   230x5x3

Press       :   120x5x3

Power clean :   160x3x5

Dip         :   75x5x3

### Notes

Not a bad day. Squat upper back tight, need to keep legs more tight on initial sets.

Press was weak.

Power cleans...good? No full cleans, jumping in a lower position now.

Dips pretty strong.

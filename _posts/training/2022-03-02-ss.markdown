Front squat :   185x3x3

Bench   :   135x9x3

Deadlift   :   225x5x3

Dip  :   55x5x3

Woodchopper : 22.5x9x3

Curl  : 17.5x5x3

### Notes

Changing up the program, going for more general athleticism, less Oly-specific. Still need to figure out exact program

Front squats good

Bench alright, easy with the right shoulder

Deads fine, make sure to keep the movement separate in your mind from cleans

Everything else fine

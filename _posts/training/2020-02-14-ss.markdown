Squat       :   195x5x3

Bench       :   180x5x3

Deadlift    :   295x5

Chinup      :   80x2x3

Skullcrusher    :   50x10,10,8

### Notes

Squats still entirely meh, not staying even over midfoot. Glad I'm seeing a trainer.

Bench not bad, it's okay to go a little faster.

Deads good, alternate grip.

Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   175x5x3

Chinup      :   25x7,7,6

### Notes

Still a bit sick. Squats were okay, decent tightness in hole. Back is pretty
vertical though. Rack is still a bit off. Good balance over midfoot and
rebounding off tight hamstrings.

Bench was a little hard...as well as uneven. Right shoulder was a bit wonky.

Chins weren't very noteworthy.

Squat       :   205x5x3

Press       :   105x5x3

Deadlift    :   285x5

### Notes

Meh workout. Woke up feeling well rested, but grew tired. Squats were okay, top of
movement _flew_ (weights were shaking). However, bottom wasn't perfect. Inconsistent
positions in the hole.

Press was whatever.

Deadlifts not that great, back not strong enough? Small jumps/keep same weight next time.

Squat       :   185x5x3

Bench       :   185x5x5

Deadlift    :   315x5

Chinup      :   40x5x3,4,3

Press       :   95x7x3

### Notes

Okay, still light and conservative. Squat not bad. Rack is okay, still need to put all
weight on back. Focus on hips/pelvis leading to good tightness in hole! Weight back more
I think.

Bench was hard lol. Not bad, keep it lower.

Deads kinda hard, not perfect form.

Tired as hell for chins.

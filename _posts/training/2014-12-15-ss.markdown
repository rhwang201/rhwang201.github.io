### Notes

Decided to reset on squats. Today was okay. Need to keep chest up and tight
more. Sit back more, make sure weight is squarely on back.

Press was meh, bar got too far away when tired.

Deads were good, alternate on last three reps.

Good forward lean on dips, but tiring.

Careful, left low back feels a bit funny, sitting down right now after the
workout.

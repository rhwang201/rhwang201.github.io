Chinup:         25x7,7,5

### Notes

Squats were okay, still a bit too deep as usual. Getting better at staying
tight in the hole though! Knees don't move as much.

Press was easy at first but hard after. Seems like my weak spot is right after
it passes the top of my head.

Deads were good, learning to keep arms straight again. Maybe could've leaned
back a bit more in the starting position.

Squat       :   185x5x3

Dip         :   25x8x3

Facepull    :   110x15x3

Curl        :   17.5x15,15,10

Leg lifts   :   0x4x3

### Notes

Not bad. Externally rotate shoulders for squat rack, and keep ass back.

Keep abs/trunk tight on press.

Dips good, get that pec stretch.

Complex was kinda hard...

Good volume on curls.

Going to start throwing in some dedicated ab work.

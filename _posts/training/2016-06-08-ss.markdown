Squat       :   135x5x5

Press       :   135x3x5

Chinup      :   90x1

Shrug       :   225x10x3

### Notes

Slept less than eight hours, but not tired for workout. God my legs are tiny. Supersetted
pause squats with press. Squat quality is variable. Still _slightly_ forward on some
reps.

Press was mostly easy. Good job leaning back, keeping bar close to face, and getting
under it.

Failed 115 and 105 chinup. Which is kind of expected. Did it for shits anyway.

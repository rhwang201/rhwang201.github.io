Deadlift  :  340x5

Bench : 170x8,8,7

Cable row : 160x10,10,9

Tricep extension  :  35x12x3

Lateral raise  :  25x14x3

Neck extension  :  15x16x3

### Notes

Deads fine. Maybe reset? Plateau-ing

Bench was hard. Better form though, pinching the shoulder blades during setup. Switch it up to strength.

Leaned forward on cable rows, probably reset a bit.

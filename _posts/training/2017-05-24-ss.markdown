Squat       :   195x5x5 

Bench       :   165x5x3

Deadlift    :   275x5x3

Chinup      :   25x5x5

### Notes

Decent upper body fatigue from Monday, good job. Squats were okay, working on form, as
usual. Keeping the trunk tight helps a lot. Take an actually-big breath to set the trunk,
and keep it tight in the hole.

Bench w/e.

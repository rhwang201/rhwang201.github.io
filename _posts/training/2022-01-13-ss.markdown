Snatch :   110x3x3

Push press  : 155x3x3

Front squat   :   225x3x3

Dip      :   75x5x3

Wood chopper  : 17.5x12x3

Box jump  : 107x3x3

### Notes

Redeemed from the prior week. Snatches not bad, pretty easy actually. Can progress. Still need to keep the bar close on second pull, and work on third pull

Push press hard, but good job.

Front squats kinda hard, think you should focus on good form here

Dips hard, good

Not fully landing all the box jumps, repeat

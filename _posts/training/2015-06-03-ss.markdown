Deadlift    :   395x5 

Pullup      :   0x10,6,5

### Notes

Fuck, Richard Hwang you are an idiot. Once again, was not super focused during squat
workouts. Was well rested. Squat actually wasn't bad, but since I progressed weight, it
really had to be perfect. I'm forcing you to take a light form day Friday.

Press was smooth as fuck. Big breath and initial tightness meant reps (especially first
rep) flew off the shoulders.

Deads looked good too, actually. Last rep fucking sucked though. Keep the bar on the
legs. Back hurts now, btw, you tard.

Pullups were whatever.

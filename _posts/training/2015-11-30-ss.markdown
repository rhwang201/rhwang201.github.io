Squat       :   225x5x3

Press       :   125x5x3;115x5x2

Deadlift    :   375x5

### Notes

Tired as fuck from flying in at 0800. Too cafeinnated too. Squat wasn't bad, but rack is
bad. Bar not sitting on rear delts, wrists not straight. Focusing on hips is good.

Press weak, got over cafeinnated and shaky.

Dead not bad, need to keep bar closer to legs.

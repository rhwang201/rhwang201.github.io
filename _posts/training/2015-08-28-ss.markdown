Squat       :   185x5x3

Bench       :   215x3

Chinup      :   90x3

Pullover    :   30x10x3

### Notes

Uninspiring workout. Tired and hungry. Right wrist was hurting. Squat tightness was okay,
but still sitting unevenly.

Bench was weak, in part because of bad squat rack (right shoulder), in part because of
wrist.

Chins were good, but probably because I'm lighter.

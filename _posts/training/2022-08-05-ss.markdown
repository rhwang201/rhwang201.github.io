Squat : 185x5x3

Pendlay row : 165x7x3

Power clean : 185x1, 175x1x2

Chinup  : 45x8,8,7

Bench : 95x5x3

Incline hammer curl : 30x8x3


### Notes

Pause squats, kept it light since lower back a bit tweaked

Rows easy

Cleans a bit hard, also did some hang powers at the end (135x3x3). Skipped deads

Go lighter on chins

Meant to go heavier for bench (105)

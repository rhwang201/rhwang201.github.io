Deadlift  :  275x5

Bench : 177.5x5x3

Row : 165x8x3

Tricep extension  :  35x14,14,13

Lateral raise  :  15x16x3

Neck extension  :  25x14x3

### Notes

Deads still good. Set the back, push through the feet. Continue.

Bench solid as well. Controlled warmup reps translated to woring sets. Maybe repeat once.

Tri's hard

Squat       :   210x5x3

Bench       :   180x5x3

Deadlift    :   365x5;275x6

### Notes

Not the best day. Squat, while not horrible, definitely regressed since Monday. Slight
discomfort on left shoulder, bar might have been too low on back. Also suspect I wasn't
setting my trunk correctly at beginning of each rep.

Bench was shaky (literally), but not too difficult.

Deads were okay, set up with bar closer to legs. Was very tired for drop-off.

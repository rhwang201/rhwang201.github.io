Squat       :   225x5x5

Deadlift    :   345x5

Curl        :   22.5x12x3

### Notes

Okay workout, shitty recovery because of Portland trip. Light squats, were okay. Rack was
slightly better. Focused on standing tall (haven't been doing that). Need to keep weight
over midfoot on ascent.

Press was okay, a little assymetric over forehead.

Deadlift pretty good. Keeping bar on the leg, shoving chest up hard.

Curls lol

### Notes

Okay day. Squats okay. Stay "hollow", ass back, knees don't move at bottom, push through
shoulders to bar.

Bench okay.

Deads okay, be careful around back. Good job staying "hollow", pushing through heels,
keeping chest up.

Tired on chins.

Quick stair run at the end, some intervals.

Anterior hip stretch, plus a bit of squatting.

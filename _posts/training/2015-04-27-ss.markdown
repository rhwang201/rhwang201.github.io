Squat       :   215x5x3

Press       :   130x5x3,4,3,3

Chinup      :   25x5x5

### Notes

First time doing non-box squats in a while, and it was okay! Posterior chain strength was
there, so the hole was comfortable. Remember to set hips before, good job on that. Rack
was pretty good, bar spot was easy to find (those traps doe).

Shoulders were heavily fatigued...maybe from bad sleep this weekend. Need to be stricter
on core tightness during rebound. I loosen up sometimes then.

Trying 5x5 chins.

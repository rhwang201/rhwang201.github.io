Squat:      190xmeh

Bench:      185x5x3

Power Clean:   155x5x3

### Notes

Squat form regressed, drop down a bit, focus on keeping trunk neutral and rib
cage down. Bench was pretty good, especially last rep. Big breath, push against
the floor, stay tight at the bottom. Power cleans were okay too, still need to
improve rack. Remember to look up (forward) before beginning pull.

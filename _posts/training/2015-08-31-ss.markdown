Squat       :   185x5x3

Press       :   125x5x3

Curl        :   45x10x5

### Notes

Well, I think it's time to deload. Crappy recovery this weekend, was very tired this
morning. Legs tired for squats... only a little bit of hip pain though.

Press was absolutely pathetic, it was what convinced me to deload soon, if not now.
Shoulders exhuasted, lockout weak.

Curled as punishment.

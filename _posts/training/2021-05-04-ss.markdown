Power clean :   185x3x3

Press   :   125x5,4,3

Squat   :   230x5x3

Chinup  :   65x5,5,4

### Notes

Cleans not bad, a couple reps had super clean "brushes" as opposed to bangs. Good height, no full cleans. Can progress

Press okay. First set the bar was too bar away from the face. Could maybe give it one more go, then reset?

Squats pretty good, tight, a little slow and controlled overall. A little forward on the ascent, but okay. Can progress

Stalling on chins...

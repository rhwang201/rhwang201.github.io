Squat:      190x5x3

Bench:      145x5x3

Power Clean:   125x5x2

### Notes

Squat was meh. Still seems like lower back may move a bit near the bottom of
the hole. Should do a lighter wait next time and focus on form. Specifically,
sitting back, keeping the back tight, keeping abs tight, and leaning over.

Bench was good, more used to the awkward rack height. 145 felt super easy. Only
thing is to make sure the descent is well controlled.

Power cleans were okay. A couple were racked in too deep of a squat. Remember
to keep your arms taut and straight the entire time, and slowly squeeze the bar
up to jumping position. Also keep it close to the chest.

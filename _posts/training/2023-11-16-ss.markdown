### Notes

Cleans eh. Got better when you went heavier. The heavy singles actually felt good. Knuckles down, bar close to the body, push the floor away, stay over the bar, pull yourself under. Maybe go with heavy singles again. Work on turnover

Reset/change up dips?

Narrow neutral grip for chins, working on bicep width

Change up facepulls, bad ROM on last reps

Step downs good

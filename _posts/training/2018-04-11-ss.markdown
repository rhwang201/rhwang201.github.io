### Notes

Decent day. Squats a lot better. Remember to do some pauses during warmups. Focused on
tucking the pelvis and staying tight in the hole.

Bench whatever, grip/positioning not great.

Focused on removing slack in the arms for deads. Weight should be on the traps. Chest up
hard during the setup. Also, weight on the heels.

Squat       :   225x5x3

Bench       :   200x5x3,4x2;175x7

Chinup      :   40x5x3,4x2;0x7

### Notes

Okay workout actually. Lots of physical activity this weekend, not enough food or sleep.
Drinking a lot of water upon waking helps so much. Squat rack not bad, on rear delts and
the "shelf". Right hip flexor a little messed up, indicating uneven tightness in hole.

Bench form not bad, but still fatigued (from pullovers Friday?) and not too strong. Form
a bit better, still uneven though.

Chins were hard. First set good form.

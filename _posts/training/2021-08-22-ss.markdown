Power clean :   190x3x3

Press   :   115x5x3

Squat   :   220x5x3

Chinup  :   70x5,5,4,3

### Notes

Not bad, despite the poor rest/drinking this weekend. Cleans feel like you're receiving low, but they look good on camera. Let's repeat once more

Press better. On last two sets, when it got hard, your shoulder pain went away. Progress again

Squats meh. Not balanced in the hole, lost back angle a couple times, left knee collapsed a bit. Repeat

Chins not bad, despite elbow pain

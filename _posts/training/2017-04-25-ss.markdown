Squat       :   175x5x3

Bench       :   165x5x3

Deadlift    :   275x5x3

Chinup      :   0x9,9,6,3

### Notes

Not a bad day actually. Focused on setting pelvis, taking big breath, and bracing abs for
squats, helped a lot.

Close grip bench.

Deads not bad. Make sure weight on traps, and entire back tight (lats, upper back, traps)

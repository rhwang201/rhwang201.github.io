### Notes

Merry Christmas! Overall, decent day. Squat form could've been better, definitely tweaked
left lower back a bit. Was having a hard time getting into the right back position. One
useful cue I noticed, though, is to think about raising the ass out of the hole; that
helps with keeping the knees from moving.

Press was good. Pushed through.

Cleans okay, a lot of reps were forward. Don't rush the beginning, think of hitting the
bar straight up to the chest, and get under the bar fast.

Dips were good, set a good grip and squeeze the bar.

Did the wrong accessory exercise, woops.

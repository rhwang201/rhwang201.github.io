Squat       :   155x5x3

Press       :   105x5x5

Deadlift    :   225x5x3

### Notes

Not enough sleep, but felt well rested. First day after a week off. Also, right wrist
injured. Need to make sure weight is a bit more towards back of foot for squat.

Press lockout flew. Got pumped for some sets, good job.

Deads were okay, remember to keep the weight on your traps.

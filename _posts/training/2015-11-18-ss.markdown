### Notes

Okay workout, almost recovered from illness. Squats kinda shitty. Absent-mindedly forgot
to do 90-90, and noticed I didn't set my pelvis. Rack is off, be careful with that. Not
tight in the hole, not staying over midfoot on ascent.

Press was boring. A little asymmetric around the top of head. Trying to keep abs tight.

Face pulls were easy.

Back extensions: lower thoracic spine sore/hurt? So back extensions a little difficult.
Didn't really do pauses.

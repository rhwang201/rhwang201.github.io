Deadlift  : 345x5

Pendlay row : 165x8x3

Chinup  : 70x5x3

Incline hammer curl : 35x5, 30x8,7

Lateral dumbbell raise  : 10x12x3

Face pull : 57.5x11x3

### Notes

Trying out push pull legs. Can probably have two strength focuses per day, other hypertrophy. For pull, can do chins second

Deads heavy but fine.

Kinda missed last chinup rep

Trying to focus on feeling of muscle, beyond just moving weight

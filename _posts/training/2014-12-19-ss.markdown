Deadlift:       335x5

### Notes

Wise light day on squats. Focused a lot on rebounding off of tight hamstrings.

Need to reset on press, too much upper body fatigue. First set last rep was
already shitty, with the whole "press the bar far away, stall for a second, and
wiggle your way under" shebang.

Deads were okay. Alternate grip all the way now. Pretty slow. Also, _may_ need
to setup closer.

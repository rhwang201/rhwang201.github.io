### Notes

Pretty bad day, not a good sign. Squats are probably too heavy, finding it hard to sit
into hole correctly. Go lighter, so you can load posterior chain correctly.

Press is pretty good.

Cleans are not good. Bar isn't going high enough, you aren't moving under it fast enough,
and you're hitting it forward, rather than up.

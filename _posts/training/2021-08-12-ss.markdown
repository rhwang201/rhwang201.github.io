Snatch  : 95x3x3

Chinup : 90x2;80x2x2

Squat :   185x5x3

Dip  : 90x2x5

### Notes

Snatch practice fine, did complexes with snatch balance, pulls, hangs, etc. Overhead position tired. Can work on more speed into the hole

Chins were okay, kinda hard. Elbow a bit strained from squats i think

Squats easy and good form

Dips easy

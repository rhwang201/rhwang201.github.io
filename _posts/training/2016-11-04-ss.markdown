Deadlift    :   395x2x2

Chinup      :   90x1x5;0x10

### Notes

Not a bad day, freaky dreams last night. Volume squats, okay. Stay back, setup back, try
"pulling" bar back to keep bar path good.

Bench was okay. One rep had ton of right shoulder movement.

Deads were pretty good! Pushed through heel, kept the bar on the legs.

Chins were chill.

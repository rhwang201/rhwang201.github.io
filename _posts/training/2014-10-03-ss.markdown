### Notes

Good morning. Front squats were okay, slowly getting better at keeping back
more upright. Press was awesome; it was tough but I pushed through all the
reps. Getting pretty good at keeping the bar over midfoot, leaning back,
keeping close to the face, getting under the bar, gripping the bar tight, and
starting with a good grip. Deads were pretty good too, after watching that
video posted on the facebook group. Grip was narrower, bar was on the legs,
pushed the floor away. Only problem was a bruise on my shin right at the start
position haha. Decided to try bodyweight chins and see what happened. First set
felt really weird unweighted, then fatigue caught up to me. Oh yea, recovery in
preparation was probably not very optimal; not much sleep and not a large
enough surplus of calories. Will try to get solid recovery this weekend.

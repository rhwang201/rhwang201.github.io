Bench       :   215x4

Chinup      :   75x5

Facepull    :   40x14x3

### Notes

One more day of resting back, hopefully last...Bench was okay, distinct lack of bounce
though.

Chins were strong.

Face pulls good.

Goblet squats pretty asymmetric, need to figure it out. Overhead mobility, clamshells,
hip.

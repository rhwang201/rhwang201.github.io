Squat       :   185x5x3

Bench       :   205x3x3

Deadlift    :   315x5

Chinup      :   45x5x3;0x8

### Notes

Not good sleep again. Squats are meh. Anterior hip is whack. Did pauses though. Main take
away from today is to set the trunk and keep it tight; that'll have down-stream effects.

Bench was aight, no spotter.

Deads were really good actually

Chins felt strong, probably because I'm lighter.

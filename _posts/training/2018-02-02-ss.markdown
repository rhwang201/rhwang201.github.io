### Notes

First day back in a while. Skiing, and had food poisoning after. Obviously lost a lot of
strength (and probably muscle mass). Squats were alright...Need to keep ass back more.
Focused on tight upper back, and neutral pelvis. Thought about bar path over mid foot.

Press pretty good, focused on keeping abs tight.

Did some clean practice, went all the way to the floor. Transition at the knee still
isn't smooth, but by itself, movement above the knee is pretty good.

Had to get back in the groove for dips, but form restored.

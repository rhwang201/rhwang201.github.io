Squat       :   185x5x3

Bench       :   185x7x3

Deadlift    :   275x7x2;225x8

Chinup      :   25x5x3

Curl        :   17.5x8x3

### Notes

Not good sleep. Squats started off shitty, but definitely improved. Right hip was weird,
but eventually started loading posterior chain correctly and things felt better.

Bench was aight.

Deads were good, dropoff was tiring.

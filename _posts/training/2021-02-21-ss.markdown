Power clean :   180x3x5

Press   :   120x5,5,4

Squat   :   205x5x3

Chinup  :   50x5x3

### Notes

Pretty good workout, despite skiing and lack of sleep. Cleans surprisingly strong, could probably go to 185 if I wasn't missing next week

Press also pretty strong overall (try to brace abs from the very first rep), but couldn't get last set

Squats pretty good, flexed lower back a bit more, which seems to help. Could stay or increase

Chins alright, rushed. Last rep a little short again

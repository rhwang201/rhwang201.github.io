Squat       :   260x5x3

Bench       :   197.5x5x3

Chinup      :   40x7,5,4

### Notes

Still not fully recovered from cold.

Squats were difficult. Need to keep trunk more tight, need to stay over
mid-foot more (especially on descent). Rack was also a bit bad, in that
I bruised my skin a bit. No arm pain!

Bench was hard. Cheated a bit at the end probably haha, need a spotter so
I don't have to worry about failing now.

Chinups were whatever.

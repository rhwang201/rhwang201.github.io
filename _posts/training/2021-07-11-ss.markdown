Power clean :   200x1;195x2x3

Press : 105x5x3

Squat   :   230x5x3

Chinup  :   65x5,5,4

### Notes

Pretty brutal day. Torn callous, ego lifting, plus the lifting yesterday. Went for 200, immediately failed. Even height on 195 was bad. Also, didn't help that you were wearing shorts. Did some complexes after at 185 and 135 - slow pull and powers. Repeat 195

Press was okay, if you really had your chest up, shoulder would be okay. Progress cautiously.

Squats were hard. Knees moving forward more, but definitely losing back angle on latter reps. Repeat.

Probably need to reset chins

Hang power snatch   :   90x3x3

Hang power clean    :   140x3x3

Slow pull   :   210x3x3

Press   :   120x5,5,4,1

Squat   :   215x5x3

Curl    :   0x12x3


### Notes

Snatches more balanced. Practiced "continuing to pull" during warmups. Cleans were
a little messy at first.

Slow pull good.

Press was good at first! Keep it fast.

Squats not bad either, stayed pretty tight overall, just watch the weight over your toes
on the ascent.

Shoulders too tight from press to OHS.

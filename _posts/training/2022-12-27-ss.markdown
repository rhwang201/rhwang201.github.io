### Notes

Skiing this past weekend, pretty fun.

Squats fine, hard. Tried to get a bit more bounce, but didn't go well. Nice tightness, upright back. Probably repeat

Press pretty good actually, easy, minimal shoulder issues. Progress

Pretty sure I missed the last pullup rep but don't remember exactly...

Everything else hard. ROM on face pulls suck, reset. Lateral raises feel good

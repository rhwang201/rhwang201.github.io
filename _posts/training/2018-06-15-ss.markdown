Squat       :   205x7x3

Bench       :   175x8x3

Deadlift    :   305x5

Chinup      :   25x7,6,5

Lateral Raise   :   25x8x3

### Notes

Volume day. Squats not bad. Make sure chest is up and shoulders are down and back. Knees
out and let the pelvis sit into the hole.

Bench okay. Left side is lagging because of shoulder flexibility.

Deads pretty good, although getting harder now. Alternate-gripped the entire set. Good
job with back setup.

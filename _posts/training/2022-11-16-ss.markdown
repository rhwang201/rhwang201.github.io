Deadlift  : 305x5x3

Bench : 160x5x3

Chinup  : 55x5x3

Cable crossover : 37x11x3

Incline hammer curl : 25x12,12,10

Machine shoulder press  : 60x12x3

### Notes

Deads were pretty good, back felt tight, pushed floor away well. Can probably think more about pushing the floor away, should get a shorter bar path. Let's do 5lb jumps to be conservative

Bench good. There was one rep with the perfect bounce (light touch, "glass"). Going too low on some reps now, not getting shoulder stretch. Need to calibrate a bit

Chins pretty easy, full ROM at top

Everything else fine

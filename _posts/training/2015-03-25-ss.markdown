Squat       :   185x5x3

Press       :   135x5x3

Chinup      :   10,10,6

### Notes

Box squats, okay. No pain per say, but still some slight discomfort revolving
around right hip. Still need to be aware of any rotation/twisting. Also pushed
back back into bar.

Press should've been easy, first set was a breeze. Psyched myself out on last
two sets, which had bad form.

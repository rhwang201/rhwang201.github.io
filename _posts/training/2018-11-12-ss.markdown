### Notes

Pretty good day fwiw. Pretty skinny now, 165. Hips a little immobile from vacation.
Working on not moving knees in hole, and big breath for trunk.

Press pretty good. Make sure to continuously brace trunk. Also, solid legs. Bar was even,
laterally.

Power cleans alright, got better as workout progressed. "Chest up" during setup, vertical
jumping position, shoot elbows forward.

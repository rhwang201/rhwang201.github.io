Power snatch :   110x3x3

Bench   :   175x5x3

Squat   :   230x5x3

Dip     :   80x5,3,3

### Notes

Snatches not bad, filmed for the first time. Looks pretty slow and controlled, can progress

Bench a little hard but good, can progress

Squats were hard, off balance a bit, good-morning-ing. repeat

Not strong enough for dips

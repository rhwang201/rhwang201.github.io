### Notes

Form-wise good, although volume-wise not great. Squats finally getting "heavy"! Form
pretty good, think we can start getting the bounce back. Just keep everything tight!

Press not bad, but ultimately not strong enough. Worked abs pretty hard.

Power cleans okay. Tighten the lats to keep the arms as strings. Think of jumping
position.

Dips okay, was going for volume, but ended up not having the stamina.

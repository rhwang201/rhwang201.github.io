Squat : 210x5x3

Press : 105x6,6,4

Pullup  : 55x5x3

Dumbbell bench  : 55x10x3

Incline curl  : 25x10x3

Face pull : 57.5x12x3

### Notes

Squats pretty good, good knee position initially. Bar path degrades over time. Could either go volume or heavier

Press okay, shoulder still a bit twinged.

Pullups easy

Bench pretty easy, played with grip a bit, can probably keep it "normal"

Good pump on curls, focusing on flexing

### Notes

Decent day. Squats better. Shoulders down, tuck the pelvis. Focus more on hip drive
during ascent. Otherwise, pretty good, can progress!

Bench good, got a spot. So much better with a spotter. Keep bar path "low". Definitely
had a lot left in the tank. Always get a spotter so you can go heavy lol.

Deads not great. Think back isn't strong enough for these working sets? Feels a lot
better on 225 dropoff. Lower weight, probably, so can tighten back comfortably.

Tried going for doubles on chins, all the second reps had limited ROM.

Limited ROM on lateral raises.

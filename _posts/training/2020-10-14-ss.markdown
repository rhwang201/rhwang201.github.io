Power snatch :   95x3x3

Bench   :   165x5x3

Front squat   :   145x5x3

Dip  :   55x5x3

### Notes

Snatch alright, technically missed one rep and made it up. Probably want to record at some point. I'd guess your turnover can be more aggressive.

Bench a little tough but fine. Squeeze harder.

Front squats fine, need to stay tight and over midfoot (going too much on heels).

Dips hard too, but got it

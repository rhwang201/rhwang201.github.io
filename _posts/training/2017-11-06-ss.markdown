### Notes

Pretty good day. Back a little tweaked upon waking up, but squats were good. Really
emphasized "chest up" on the rack setup, which helped a lot. Sitting "back" into the hole
and keeping tight.

Bench was good, kept it fast.

Deads were improved, from keeping back tight. Though both about the lats as well as
"chest up", for the traps.

Chins were really good, fast sets.

Squat:      155x5x5

Bench:      180x5x3

Power Clean:   150x5x3

### Notes

Good day. Squat was good, keep tension on anterior and posterior side. Got
video. Bench is okay, wrist hurt a bit, left shoulder felt a bit weird. Keep
tight all the way, hold breath as long as possible. PCs were pretty great.
Keeping the bar on the legs/thighs is super important. Also setup with weight
over midfoot is super helpful. Take beginning warmup sets slow, and then speed
up.

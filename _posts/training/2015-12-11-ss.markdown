Squat       :   205x8x3

Bench       :   215x3;185x5

Chinup      :   75x1

Back Extension   :  25x12x3

### Notes

Chill day, dicked around a bit. Higher rep squats were pretty good, I was huffing and
puffing. Form was pretty good too, sat into hole well (ass back, while also allowing
knees to go forward a bit).

Bench power was solid, despite fatigued pressing muscles!

Chinup was easy, lots of head pressure though.

Back extensions were controlled.

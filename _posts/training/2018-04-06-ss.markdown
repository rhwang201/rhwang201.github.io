Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   215x2x3

Chinup      :   90x2x3

Lateral Raise   :   25x9x3

### Notes

Okay day. Back not great overall. Squats could be tighter, don't increase weight. Had
difficulty keeping back tight and sitting into hole.

Bench was pretty easy.

Skipped deadlift, because of back.

Chins pretty good.

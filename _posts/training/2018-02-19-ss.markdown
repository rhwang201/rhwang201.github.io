### Notes

Not a bad day. Mount Diablo hike over the weekend, so body a little tired. Squats not
bad, focused on elbows down and chest up. Keep the weight back.

Bench alright, but failed last rep (dumped laterally). Really need a spotter now...

Deads better, used overhand grip for the entire set. "Shorten" the back, tighten the
lats, and keep the bar close.

Chins good.

ROM on lateral raises good, except for last couple of reps.

Power snatch :   100x3x3

Bench   :   165x5x3

Squat   :   200x5x3

Dip     :   55x5x3

### Notes

Solid day, though woke up groggy and didn't feel fully recovered. Snatches fine; what helped on the last set was taking the first pull slow. Think I had a more precise seond pull and receiving position because of that. Maybe repeat?

Bench easy.

Squats kinda hard. Probably increase one more time, then start repeating

Dips easy

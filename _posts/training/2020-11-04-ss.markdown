Power snatch :   100x3x3

Push press   :   120x3x3

Front squat   :   160x5x3

Dip  :   55x5x3

Curl :   17.5x11x3

### Notes

Not bad, though ab/rib cage is injured. Power snatch pretty good actually, feels tight, good height and receiving. Make sure to contact the hips. Also, shoulders down and back

Push press instead of bench because of ab injury

Front squat alright, think chest up a lot more

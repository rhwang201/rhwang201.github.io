Squat:          Low weight reps, 95 most I think

Press:          115x5x3

Deadlift:       235x5 

Chinups

### Notes

Squats kinda sucked again. Need to rest. Press was hard but do-able. It
actually makes sense that it's hard, because it is proportionally higher than
other lifts. Deadlift suffered as a result of the squat stressing back.

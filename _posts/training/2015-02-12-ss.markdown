Squat       :   175x5x5

Bench       :   210x5

Deadlift    :   205x5x3,135x8

### Notes

Squat was meh today, too many people around and got distracted. Need to be
careful not to dive into the hole.

First high intensity bench day! Was challenging, but got it. Would have been
easier with a good spotter.

Threw in deadlifts just for fun, used the 'breathe into the lower back' cue and
it was good. Arms were good too.

No mobility today, in a rush.

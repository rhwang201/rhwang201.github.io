Squat       :   205x5;185x5x2

Press       :   125x5x5

Chinup      :   35x7,5,5

### Notes

Meh day. Felt really tired and fatigued. Squat was horrible, not positioned in hole
correctly. Hopefully dropping weight prevented injury-forming shitty form.

Press was good when I took a big breath and kept trunk tight.

Super unmotivated for chins.

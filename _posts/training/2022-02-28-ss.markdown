Clean :   185x3x3

Press   :   115x5x3

Squat   :   205x5x3

Chinup  :   60x5x3

Bulgarian Split Squat : 40x12x3

### Notes

Not bad, focused on staying over the bar for cleans, as well as a planted foot (avoiding rocking). Both felt pretty good.

Focused on a solid trunk (both abs and chest) for press

Everything else fine

Can switch up program maybe/add bench press for aesthetics

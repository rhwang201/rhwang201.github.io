Squat       :   205x6x3;135x5x3

Bench       :   185x6,6,5

Deadlift    :   285x5

Pullup      :   65x5,4,4,4

### Notes

Not a bad day. Might ease to more volume. Squats not bad, trying to have knees go forward
in beginning of movement. Did light sets at end of workout, to grease groove.

Bench good, held breath for a while. No spot, hence last set.

Deads good, setting lower back better.

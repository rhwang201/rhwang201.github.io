Squat:          195x5x3

Press:          125x5x3

Deadlift:       265x5

Pullup:         25x7,5,4

### Notes

Squats were okay. Still a bit too low as usual. Some reps had good bounce!
Think of leaning over a bit more, keeping the ass back, and bracing the abs.

Press (apparently) looked really easy. Focused more on bracing the abs today.
Eccentric portions were a bit shaky.

Deadlifts were easy. Focused on keeping the weight on the traps, need to do
a better job of that during setup. Back angle looked good though.

Pullups were okay. Didn't get as full ROM as chinups.

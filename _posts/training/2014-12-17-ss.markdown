Squat       :   225x5x3

Bench       :   202.4x5x3

Chinup      :   0x12,6,4

### Notes

Slept around 5hrs last night. Squats were meh. Was supposed to do 240 but reset
even more...Should re-read some material and re-learn it. Might be going too
low, definitely not keeping tension on posterior chain. Focused on sitting back
and leaning over today.

Got bench! Definitely felt very fatigued today. Second set, right shoulder
started to collapse a bit and move near the bottom of the movement. Corrected
in on third set, but take notice next time.

Triceps were burtn for chinups.

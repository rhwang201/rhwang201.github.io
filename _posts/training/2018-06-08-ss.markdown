### Notes

Alright day. Got less sleep, also worked at a different rack than usual (in the back).
Squats felt heavy but not bad. Decent job on bounce, make sure staying back though.

Press wasn't that great. Form doesn't feel great? Maybe limited by technique, muscles
don't feel very fatigued.

Cleans pretty good for the most part.

Good job staying tight on dips. Also thought about pressing shoulders (scapula) down.

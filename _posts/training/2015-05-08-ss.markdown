Bench       :   215x3x2

Deadlift    :   355x5;265x7

Chinup      :   55x3x3

### Notes

First set of bench was *not* legit (horrible spotter), so I did it again. Right shoulder
area was really hurting.

Back was really tired for deadlifts. In fact, I was really tired overall.

Actually tried squatting after benching, but the rack was too shitty. Need to fix it.

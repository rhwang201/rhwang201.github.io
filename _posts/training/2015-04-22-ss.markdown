Squat       :   215x5x3

Press       :   125x5x3

Chinup      :   10,10,6,5

### Notes

Not the best sleep, but good enough. Squat was pretty strong. Be sure to keep back angle
constant out of hole. Also a bit of elbow irratation from last set, probably wasn't being
very disciplined with setup.

Press was _strong_. Sweet. Strength off the bottom is good.

Low intensity chins.

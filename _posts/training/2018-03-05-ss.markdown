### Notes

Pretty good day, despite ski weekend. Kept squats lighter, and they were a lot better.
Better at sticking chest out now (lol). Neck back on the ascent.

Bench pretty good. Fingerprints in the bar. Good bar path.

Kept deads lighter. "Short" back, and pushed through the heels.

Good job pushing a bit on chins.

Good ROM on lateral raises.

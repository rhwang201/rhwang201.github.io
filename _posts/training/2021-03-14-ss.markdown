Power clean :   180x3x3

Press   :   115x5,5,4

Squat   :   205x5x3

Chinup  :   50x5,5,4

### Notes

Not the best recovery/sleep/sufficient calories. Went for it on cleans, pretty good. Back does feel like it's not strong enough. I say progress.

Press alright, focusing on core for most of the workout. Also try to keep the weight over your wrists.

Squats pretty good. Try to keep knees in line with feet. Split between repeating or progressing...maybe see how you feel next workout.

Chins kinda rushed, also not super strong

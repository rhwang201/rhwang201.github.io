Power snatch :   115x3x3

Bench   :   165x7x3

Overhead squat   :   105x3x3

Chinup     :   60x5x3

### Notes

Snatches alright, started slow. Make sure to contact aggressively and set the back. Rack was a bit weak. Could maybe progress.

Shoulder felt better for bench, can maybe go heavy again next week.

OHS pretty good actually, can progress

Last chin rep was barely there, probably repeat

### Notes

Pretty good day actually. Back felt better for squats, although rack is now off. Ass
back, breath into trunk.

Press was okay. First set felt strong, but wasn't tight for second set and failed second
rep. Take a big breath, set up, and push evenly.

Dips were strong, but wasn't stretching chest correctly at bottom. Stay back more.

Stairs were fun, did some hard intervals, got heart pumping.

### Notes

Shitty recovery from Tahoe weekend. Squats were okay, stay tight in bottom of hole.

Bench was pretty hard, good job today. Keep neck off the bench, drive through heels,
squeeze the bar.

Back was not feeling good for deadlifts...be careful. Probably rest it a bit.

Chins were really strong/easy. I guess you lost some weight?

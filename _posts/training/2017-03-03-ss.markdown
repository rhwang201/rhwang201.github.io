Squat   :   195x7x3

Bench   :   225x2

Deadlift    :   365x5

Chinup  :   105x1 (fail)

### Notes

Eh, shitty day. In a rush. Squats are not right...Anterior right knee hurts a bit now,
right ass not great either. Keep weight low.

Bench easy, but no good spotter (and in a rush), so left it at that.

Weight is not on traps for deads.

Failed 110 and 105 for chins. Missing top ROM

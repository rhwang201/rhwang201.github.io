### Notes

Better rested than Monday. Legs are still a bit weird though...Squats are a lot better,
seems like I'm using my lats now more correctly to help maintain back angle. Weight
doesn't feel fully back though (shoving ass back, but weight still seems a bit far
forward on feet?). Losing balance if I go too far back, legs might be weak?

Press good. Pull rib cage down when tightening abs.

Dips chill.

Complex getting better. Also, stay back on squats. High bar back squat rack getting
better.

Erg fun.

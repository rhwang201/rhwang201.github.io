Power snatch :   110x3x3

Push press   :   130x3x3

Squat   :   225x5x3

Dip     :   75x5x3

### Notes

Snatch pretty good, thinking about pushing up on the second pull, knees out during the setup helps. Banged the bar against the pubic bone a bit too much on the last rep when focused on hitting it. Can repeat again

Push press pretty easy, can progress

Squats good again, mostly even on the up (a few initial reps actually weren't centered on the descent). Can repeat

Dips were hard but you got them, well done

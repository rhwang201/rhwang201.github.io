### Notes

Rushed day, not much sleep, but not bad. Being a little aggressive on squats, be careful.
It's okay for bad to be horizontal-ish. Push up through pelvis, not chest.

Press easy, good job squeezing bar.

Power cleans okay. Keep it slow at the bottom, and accelerate at top. Heavy rep was
questionable lol. Need to get under quicker.

Dips easy, adjusted left hand positioning a bit to deal with circulation.

Supersetted facepulls with pullups. Pullups were strong.

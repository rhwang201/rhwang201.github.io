Squat       :   195x5x3

Press       :   115x5x3

Dip         :   45x5x5

Back Extension  :   10x11x3

### Notes

Squats are shitty, keep the weight low. Not staying back, weight is definitely shifting
forward. Mobility issue.

Press was hard, but better than last time.

Dip easy.

Can jump off back extension.

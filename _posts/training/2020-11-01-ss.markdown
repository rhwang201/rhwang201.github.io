Power clean :   160x3x3

Press   :   105x5x3

Squat   :   185x5x3

Chinup  :   35x5x3

### Notes

Meh day, probably too heavy overall. Cleans were sloppy, poor height, poor rack. Redo

Press was decent

Squats might've been too heavy as well, back feels a bit strained. Didn't seem that bad in the moment though

Chins were good, probably because I lost weight.

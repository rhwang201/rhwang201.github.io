Press       :   115x5x3

Deadlift    :   225x7x3

Dip         :   0x16,15,10

Back Extension  : 0x10x3

### Notes

Lower back still shitty. High fatigue. Press was boring.

Deads were boring. Focused on keeping weight over mid-foot.

Dips are mostly to depth now. Pretty sore still from bench.

Back extensions with 10s pause at end, 1s pause between reps.

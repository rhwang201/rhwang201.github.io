Squat:      135

Bench:      175x5x3

Power Clean:   145x5x3

### Notes

Distracted, obviously, after breaking up with Jiwon.

Did form sets with squat, actually not that bad. Stay over the mid-foot, think
about your ass, don't put your knees out too much.

Bench was meh. Grip the bar super tight.

Power cleans weren't great. I attribute it to the distraction.

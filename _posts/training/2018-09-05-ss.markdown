Squat       :   195x5x3

Press       :   115x5x3

Power Clean :   160x3x5

Dip         :   55x5x3

Curl        :   22.5x11x3


### Notes

Squats good, practicing breathing still. Externally rotate shoulders on rack, also hips
during movement.

Power cleans alright, rack was bad at first. Remember to get to a _vertical_ jumping
position.

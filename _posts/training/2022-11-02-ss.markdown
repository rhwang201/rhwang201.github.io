Deadlift  : 305x5x3

Bench : 160x5x3

Chinup  : 50x5x3

Cable crossover : 33x12x3

Incline hammer curl : 25x12,12,10

Lateral dumbbell raise  : 17.5x14x3

### Notes

Deads still not good, maybe drop off one more time. Back just doesn't feel tight, moreso sensitive

Bench okay, getting harder. Keep progression slow

Chins easy

Good pump on other stuff. Make sure to get full ROM on cable crossover

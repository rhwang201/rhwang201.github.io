Power snatch :   105x3x3

Push press   :   125x3x3

Squat   :   220x5x3

Dip     :   75x5,4,4

### Notes

Technically missed one snatch rep, from form. Should probably do a light form session next time, don't sacrifice aggressiveness too much.

Push press fine

Squat not great. Again some reps okay, others not. Don't increase (repeat or reset). Think "up", big open chest.

Weak dips as well, bottom really loose.

Overall, unfocused for the day (less sleep?)

### Notes

Alright day, you look pretty skinny, might not be eating enough. A couple gaffs, since
different routine as a result of WFH (wrong weight on snatch, went fast on pull).

Still need to get back on front squat and chest up.

Back squat not great, pay attention next workout.

Should be good to add weight for OHS.

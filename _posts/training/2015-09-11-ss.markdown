Squat       :   175x5x3

Bench       :   175x5x3

Back Extension  :   0x12x3

### Notes

Pretty well rested, just noticed I wasn't hungry?? Squats were okay, first set form
really good. Set hips, shoulders down, head back, big breath.

Bench was pretty weak. Also cautious with wrist. Super uneven.

Back extensions for whatever. Wrist almost better.

Hip, clam shells, bridge, overhead

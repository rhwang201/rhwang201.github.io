Chinup  :   55x5x3

Back extension  : 10x12x2

### Notes

Not the best sleep recovery last few nights. Power cleans better, keeping bar close during the second pull. Still tweaking mid back a little though, not sure if on pull or receive. Can progress

Press a little weak, think part of it is mental/form. Feels more difficult to take a good breath in the bottom position. Bar staying close to the face though, and trunk feels tight.

Squats good. Big breath, tight back, knees forward a bit on descent, gripping the floor and bouncing well. Can progress

Chins good, more limited ROM now. Can progress (close to limits)

Back extensions easy

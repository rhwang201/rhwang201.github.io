Deadlift  : 310x5x3

Bench : 165x5x3

Chinup  : 60x5x3

Cable crossover : 37x12x3

Incline hammer curl : 25x12,12,8

Incline dumbbell bench  : 30x12x3

### Notes

Deads getting harder. Always a bit hard to start off with deads when cold...

Bench also kinda hard. Can maybe progress one more time, be careful

Chins easy-ish

Crossovers hard, reset curls, incline was new and felt good

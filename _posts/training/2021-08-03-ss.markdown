Snatch :   95x5x3

Overhead squat   :   120x3x3

Dip      :   80x5,5,4,2

Curl    : 15x12x3

Back extension  : 45x12x3

### Notes

Full snatches, plus technique. Slow pull, hang from above the knees, snatch. Not bad, think about a tight back and upwards leg drive.

OHS pretty hard, think the mirror messed you up. Stay stacked, knees forward, weight over the midfoot. Progress cautiously.

Dips fine but hard, repeat.

Supersetted last two, curls easy, back extensions fine

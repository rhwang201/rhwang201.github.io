Squat       :   230x5x3

Press       :   130x5x3,4x2,2x1

Chinup      :   37.5x5x5

### Notes

Absolute shit recovery this weekend, barely any calories, not enough sleep. Squat was
okay, no pain. Changing mechanics through the workout. Kept trunk tight on a lot of reps
though. Quads were very tired. Need to keep knees stable in the hole.

Way too tired for press. Very strong off the shoulders, trouble above the head. Also,
starting to lean back heavily. Abs getting worked a lot.

Chins were solid.

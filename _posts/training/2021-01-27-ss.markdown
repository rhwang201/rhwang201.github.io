Power snatch :   105x3x3

Bench   :   180x5x3

Squat   :   215x5,5,3

Dip     :   75x4x3

### Notes

Pretty rough day. Stop being so ambitious after a break in lifting. Snatches alright, though still not receiving in a strong position. Don't advance

Bench alright, might've missed the last rep (forget). Don't progress

Squats pretty bad, weight forward in the foot, not maintaining back angle. Reset a bit after coming back

Supersetted dips, not bad but barely any rest

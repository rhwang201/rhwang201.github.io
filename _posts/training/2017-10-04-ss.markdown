### Notes

Good day. Kept a more neutral weight distribution on the foot, and squats (and overall
mobility) were actually a lot better. Still need to consciously think about keeping
weight back in hole and on ascent, but not as drastically as before.

Bench easy, and good. Kept neck off bench, lightly touched piece of glass on chest.

Deads pretty good today. Main things are to remember to keep back angle "horizontal" at
start, and to squeeze the chest up during setup.

Really tired for chins.

Pigeon pose, calf stretch, and a bit of meditating.

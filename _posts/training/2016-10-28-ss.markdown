Squat       :   215x5x3

Press       :   145x1;135x2x2

Dip         :   100x2x5

### Notes

Not a great day. Rushed, tired, hungry haha. Squats weren't bad actually. Thought about
doing that "closed" body position, seemed to help keep things tight. Did the first half
of reps pause. Add back more though, and chest up more. Also, right shoulder is weird.

Press could've been so much more.

Dips were good, also could've been more.

Squat       :   235x5x3

Bench       :   215x2x3

Deadlift    :   305x5

Chinup      :   90x2x3

Lateral Raise   :   27.5x5x3

### Notes

Finally got decent sleep. Not very hungry recently. Squats are meh, need to be sure to
sit _down_, rather than too far back. Although, that's not to say don't keep your ass
back. Also, keep weight on back, rather than arms.

Bench is pretty easy. Shoulders down and relaxed, big breath, drive through heels.

Deads alright, be careful here.

Chins easy.

Lateral raise ROM limited near top.

Squat       :   185x7x3;135x7

Bench       :   185x5x5;155x7

Deadlift    :   275x7x2

### Notes

First day back after being sick wasn't that great. Squat rack was meh, squat itself not
horrible. Right hamstring almost fully healed. Sitting back and putting tension on
hamstrings well.

Bench was pretty slow but okay.

Tired as fuck for deadlifts, grip tired because of wider bar.

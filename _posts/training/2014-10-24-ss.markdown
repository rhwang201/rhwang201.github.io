Front Squat :   185x5x3

Bench       :   165x5x3

Power Clean :   140x3x5

### Notes

Somehow tweaked by back while carrying my bag this morning I think...

Front squats were okay, maybe a bit loose at the bottom.

Bench was easy! Also, maybe stay a bit tighter at the bottom.

Power cleans were meh. I think my starting position is better (lower) now.
Thought a lot today about slowly getting the bar off the floor, straight arms,
higher jumping position, and keeping it close to the chest.

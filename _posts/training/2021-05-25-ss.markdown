Power snatch :   105x3x3

Bench   :   185x5x3

Squat   :   205x5x3

Dip     :   75x5,5,4

### Notes

Snatch okay, missed one rep in the last set due to form. Need to get more solid receives/practice full snatches

Bench hard-ish but got it. Can progress

Light squat day (85%). Last reps were pauses. A bit forward, legs still tired too.

Dips good, but couldn't make it all the way

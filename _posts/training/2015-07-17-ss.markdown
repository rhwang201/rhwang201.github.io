Bench       :   215x5

Deadlift    :   325x5;225x5

Chinup      :   70x5

Dip         :   80x5

### Notes

7 hours of sleep, but felt pretty good. Was hungry though, didn't eat enough for dinner.
Bench _would have_ been good. Did the banded distraction for setting humerus. Made sure
bench hit on high point of chest by nipples (think "low"). However, spotter messed up
working set and helped a bit on last rep.

Deads were whatever, focused on keeping weight on midfoot (back).

Chins were good! Done on smaller bar though.

Dips were good, last rep was shitty though.

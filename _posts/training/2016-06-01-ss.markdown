Bench       :   165x5x3

Deadlift    :   225x10x3

Back Extension  :   70x9x5

Facepull    :   50x12x5

Press       :   145x1

### Notes

Had to ride to work, so drinking coffee during workout, which unsettled stomach. Pause
benches, not bad.

Deads were sloppy, but last set better. Quads tired.

Back extensions hard.

Facepull form might be becoming more correct. More internal rotation, pulling more at
face.

Press for giggles. Failed 155.

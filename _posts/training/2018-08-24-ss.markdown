Squat       :   195x6x3

Bench       :   185x6x3

Deadlift    :   270x5

### Notes

Overslept. Squats weren't bad, learning to take a big breath again. Also, "elbows down",
but be sure to stay in the slot on the way up.

Bench not noteworthy, form not perfect yet (doesn't feel "greased").

Deads good, "short" back.

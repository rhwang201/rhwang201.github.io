### Notes

Alright day, got some vaccines, so shoulder a bit sore. Stomped today for snatches,
timing is good. Think it's okay to lean over a little bit.

Push press pretty good.

Squats better. Front weight is pretty even now, back as well. Staying tight helps,
obviously.

Make sure fully locked out for OHS.

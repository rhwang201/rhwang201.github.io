### Notes

Lightened it up today, to get technique down. Oly better, trying to get rid of that pause
and bump thing you do. For both, think you need to get a bit more knee bend in power
position. Also keep lats and back super tight, to prevent that premature shrug.

Squats better, kept it light to get used to shoes. Make sure to keep tight for the
ascent, losing a bit of back angle out of the hole.

OHS a lot better today.

Bench       :   175x5x3

Dip         :   0x15,14,14

Facepull    :   20x12x3

Back Extension  :   0x12x3

### Notes

Not much sleep last night, but not too tired. Distraction bench warmup. Focused on
keeping it even, paused last rep. Okay.

Dips were good, also focused on control, so kept the reps slow. Depth is good now.

Tried facepulls for the hell of it.

Back extensions good.

Hip flexor mobility afterwards, plus testing goblet squat.

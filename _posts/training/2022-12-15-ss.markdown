Power clean : 175x3x3

Bench : 140x12,12,11

Pallof press  : 25x14x3

Dumbbell press  : 35x12x3

Bulgarian split squat : 70x12x3

Cable lateral raise : 5.5x12x3

### Notes

Cleans okay, first set super easy, degraded. A bit of rowing, but mostly okay. Just need a more solid receiving position. Repeat

Bench good, probably failed because of back to back days, repeat

Let's go up to 15 reps for pallof

Dumbbell good, went seated. Maybe one more time, and focus on hypertrophy?

BSS hard, geez.

Lateral raises feel gooood

Squat       :   205x5x3

Press       :   130x5,4,4

Dip         :   75x5x5

Curl        :   20x10,10,6

### Notes

Decently fatigued today.  Squats were meh. Right shoulder is super weird on rack...Some
of the last reps seemed pretty good actually, when I was less really-tense and more kinda
sat back into loading the hamstrings.

Press was hard.

Dips were okay. Potentially loose on anterior delts.

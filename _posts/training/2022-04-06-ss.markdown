Front squat : 195x3x3

Press : 120x5,5,4

Deadlift  : 255x5x3

Pendlay row : 145x9x3

Dip : 75x5x3

Cable crossover : 20x10x3

Pullup  : 0x10,10,7,6,5


### Notes

Front squats pretty good, thinking "tripod" helped stay centered on the ascent

Rows harder to keep strict

Super-setted cable crossovers and pullups. Some banded work at the end (heavy band)

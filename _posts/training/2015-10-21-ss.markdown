Squat       :   205x5x3

Press       :   105x5x5

Deadlift    :   335x5

Curl        :   22.5x12,12,8

### Notes

Eh, a little hungry. Squats weren't that good, wasn't that focused on warmups. Rack and
tightness were both meh. Knee a little banged up from football and hitting it on the
train, so had trouble keeping tightness on left side.

Press boring.

Deadlift was okay...form wasn't as good as it should've been. Maybe chest up more?

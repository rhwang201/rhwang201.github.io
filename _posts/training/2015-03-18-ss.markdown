Squat       :   195x5,185x5

Bench       :   180x5x3

Deadlift    :   340x5,270x8

### Notes

Squat sucks, fuck.

Bench was actually a bit difficult. Need to focus on right shoulder health.

Double overhand for first two reps, then switched to alternate, which wildly
threw off technique. Keep it close to the body.

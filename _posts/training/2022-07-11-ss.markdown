### Notes

Squats getting hard, can probably progress one more time, then maybe start switching it up

Cleans alright, but starfishing a bit. Probably repeat/add more volume

Shoulders improved from last week, considering you played volleyball yesterday, but not good enough to lift heavy. Keep it light

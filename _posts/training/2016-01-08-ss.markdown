Squat       :   185x5x3

Press       :   125x3x3

Chinup      :   35x5x5

Bench       :   135x8x3

### Notes

Better day. Squat okay, rack is better, knee positioning not fully there yet.

Wrist is a little fucked up, probably from chinups. Abs losing tension when moving under
the bar.

Chinups strong?? Probably because I lost weight.

Close grip bench fun.

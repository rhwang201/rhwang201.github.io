### Notes

Body not fully recovered, football the day before. Cleans were okay, think there just wasn't enough gas in the tank. Third rep was usually a full clean. Also did some hang practice at 135. Repeat obviously

Press better. Gripping bar, form seems improved. Keeping tension on delts more now? Continuing increasing cautiously.

Squats okay. Set the knees after a while and just think about the hips, in and out of the hole. Can progress

Chins easy, can progress

Snatch practice

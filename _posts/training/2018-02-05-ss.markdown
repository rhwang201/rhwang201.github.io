Squat       :   195x5x3

Bench       :   195x5x3

Deadlift    :   275x5x2

Chinup      :   45x5x3

Lateral Raise   :   22.5x10x3

### Notes

First "normal" day back at it. Squats were okay. When doing form practice at the end of
workout (just bodyweight), it felt a lot better. Keep pelvis neutral when getting into
hole. Weight was forward during working sets. Maybe spend a bit more time warming up the
movement...Should be conservative with weight.

Bench was a little difficult, left tricep was lagging.

Deads were pretty good. Thought about the lats and upper back (ie, the neck area).

Chins good.

ROM on lateral raises limited near top...

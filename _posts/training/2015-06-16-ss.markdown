Squat       :   185x5x5

Press       :   115x5x3

Dip         :   0x12x3

### Notes

Well rested, but not a good workout (in part because I was worrying about Lyme
Disease...). Squat was meh. Rack was pretty shitty actually. Was better at sitting in the
hole. Perhaps widen stance a bit.

Press felt fatigued but was whatever.

Dips were fun. Make sure to go low enough. Pause on last rep.

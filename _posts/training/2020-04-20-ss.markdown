Hang power snatch   :   80x3x5

Slow pull   :   185x3x3

Push Press  :   125x3,3,2

### Notes

Pulling erectors are really weak huh. Hangs fine, for first rep, including slow second
pull.

Also doing second pull for slow pull, feels better.

Arms too tired for push press, but rack is better?

Also pretty tired for squats, watch out for form here...

Chins easy.

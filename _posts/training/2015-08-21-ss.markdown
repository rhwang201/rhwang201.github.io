Squat       :   165x5x3

Press       :   140x3

Dip         :   90x5

Facepull    :   40x15x3

### Notes

Squat wasn't bad, no hip problems. Hip bridge to warm up. Ass back helped keep things
tight. Just be sure to stay over midfoot for the entire movement. Keep head back.

Press was okay, back still gets a little aggravated...

Dips were strong! I don't think I was going to full depth though, so I did one extra rep
at the end to get the feel.

Facepulls good.

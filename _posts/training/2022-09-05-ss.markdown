Squat : 215x5x3

Bench : 135x9x3

Power clean : 180x3x3

Chinup  : 70x5x3

Incline machine bench : 35x10x3

Side external rotation  : 2.5x16x3

### Notes

Squats okay, though not great. Can do a quicker, still tight, bounce. Good call on going lighter.

Bench good! Old external rotation cues (bend/spread the bar) really helped.

Cleans okay. Not perfect, but good enough for now

Chins easy, machine bench also good

Foam roll, ankle mobility, sun salutation

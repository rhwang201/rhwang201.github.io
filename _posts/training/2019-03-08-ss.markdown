Squat       :   225x5x3

Press       :   135x3x3

Power Clean :   185x1x3;145x5

Dip         :   110x2,1;45x10


### Notes

Meh day, drank last night. Remember to drink a lot of water. Squats pretty good honestly.
Second and third sets, kept knees from moving in hole.

Press not bad, can maybe brace core more.

Second single was an actual power clean.

Form was bad on dips (distracted).

### Notes

Pretty tired from snowboarding, soccer, lack of sleep, etc. Not horrible day though.
Squat was okay, could be more certain on rack and tighter in hole.

Press wasn't bad! Got tired though. Kept core decently tight.

Was going for five on deadlift (after being frustrated at missing press), but felt pretty
straining on lower back, so quit early.

Tired by the time I got to chins.

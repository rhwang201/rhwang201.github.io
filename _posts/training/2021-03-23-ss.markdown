Power snatch :   100x3x3

Bench   :   165x5x3

Squat   :   210x5x3

Dip     :   65x5x3

### Notes

Snatch not perfect, not getting great height on some reps. Could try progressing I guess, would be nice to get some technique practice in before.

Bench pretty easy.

Squats better, big breath, tight back, bouncing.

Dips hard-ish but got it. Can progress

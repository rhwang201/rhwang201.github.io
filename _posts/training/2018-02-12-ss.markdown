Squat       :   200x5x3

Press       :   120x5x3

Power Clean :   95x3x3

Dip         :   70x5,5,4,3

Curl        :   25x10,10,6,5

### Notes

Squat pretty good actually. Bar "back", neutral pelvis, ass back. Can increase weight.

Press pretty good, focused on "hollow" position, bracing the abs, and squeezing the bar.

More power clean practice. Need to get used to transition at knee, and changing back
angle at the top.

Dips okay, a little undisciplined during one set and let weights swing.

Front Squat:    135x5x3

Press:          125x5x3

Deadlifts:      225x5

Chinups:        25x6,6,5

### Notes

Front squats were okay, knees more forward, back tighter and more upright.
Press was okay, but on the last rep, my core loosened up a lot. Keep the weight
closer to your face and brace your waist the entire time. Deadlifts actually
felt good. Cueing the reverse movement on the way down helped a lot. Chins felt
pretty strong.

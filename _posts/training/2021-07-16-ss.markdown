Power Snatch  : 85x3x3

Pullup  : 55x5x3

Squat :   195x5x3

Dip     :  55x6x3

Box Jump   :   107cmx3x3

### Notes

Snatch practice, second pull. Did complexes with slow deadlifts, pulls, powers. Slow powers seem to be helpful. Think of it as a leg movement, not an arm one.

"5s pause" for squats, kind of hard. In reality, probably 3s. Bar path looks back on descent, forward on ascent.

Dips easy

Box jumps not exact, also using hands

Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   195x5x5

Deadlift    :   345x5;275x6

### Notes

Squat core was good, but rack sucked again gahh. Taking a big breath and setting helped
a lot. Right shoulder and elbow were irritated. Oh, and everything was ~4 minute rest
today (had to rush for meeting).

Would've killed bench, if not for crappy rack. Still got all my reps.

Scab on knee, so deads thrown off a bit, but still got everything.

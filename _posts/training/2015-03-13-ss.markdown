Squat       :   185x5x3

Bench       :   225x3

Deadlift    :   325x5,255x8

### Notes

Squat sucks. Right leg relaxes and slides forward, had to consciously correct
that in the hole. Rack is still off. Maybe start doing unilateral work?

Bench PR!! Pretty asymmetric, strength was good though. Almost got a fourth...

Deads were okay, need to keep back angle more constant off the floor. Grip
strength is good though!

Squat and couch.

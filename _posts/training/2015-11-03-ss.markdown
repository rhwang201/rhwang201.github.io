Squat       :   185x5x3

Press       :   105x5x3

Deadlift    :   365x5

Facepull    :   35x15x3

Curl        :   20x12x3

### Notes

Light, form day, with less recovery (schedule this week shifted because gym closed
Friday). Good form on squats, focused on putting bar on "shelf", staying over midfoot,
bracing the abs.

Press was okay, also focused on bracing abs and taking a big breath.

Deads not bad. Back could be in a bit more extension.

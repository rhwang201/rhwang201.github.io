Squat       :   220x5x3

Press       :   120x5x3

Dip         :   65x5x5

Back Extension  :   45x10x4

Curl        :   45x10x3,7x1

### Notes

Squat was okay. Decided to just go for it and increase weight. Rack is a bit shaky...Look
forward more.

Press was good, chest up, abs braced, mostly over midfoot.

Dip was heavy, but got it all.

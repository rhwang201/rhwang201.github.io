### Notes

Trained at Linkedin today. Also started intermediate programming for presses.
Squat was okay, need to balance over midfoot during initial descent better.

Bench was okay, the setup at linkedin (squishy bench + weird rack) threw me off
a bit, but got all my reps.

Chins were weaker than expected too, maybe because I was wearing a vest. Was
trying to go for higher reps...

Bodyweight squat and overhead mobility.

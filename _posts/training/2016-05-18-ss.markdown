Bench       :   175x7x3

Deadlift    :   225x7x3

Chinup      :   15x7x2,6,1

Facepull    :   45x13x5

Curl        :   45x7x3

### Notes

Slept late, but not too tired. Bench wasn't bad, but definitely a little loosey at
bottom. Shoulders get loose. Bar path got better though. Wrist and hands still a little
weird?

First set of deads, lower back hurt a bit. But, then I _engaged my lats_, which made such
a huge difference. Pull the bar into you. Grip also got a good workout (thicker bar).

Chins were whatever.

Facepull probably cheating a bit.

Hand a little strained from curls?

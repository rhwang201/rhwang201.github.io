Squat       :   185x5x3

Press       :   135x5x5

Chinup      :   20x7x3

### Notes

Squat was okay...kept it light. "Head back into the bar" is a good cue for
keeping my back tight. Also, put the weight fully on your back before
unracking.

Press was good!! Very pleased with this, especially considering far sub-optimal
recovery this weekend. Perhaps a bit loose, though, keep the core tight
throughout the entire movement.

Chins were good.

Squat, glute bridges. Right side shakes a lot...?

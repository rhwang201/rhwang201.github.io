### Notes

Weekend of backpacking, so fatigue and inadequate recovery. Coffee, though, so didn't
feel too bad in beginning. Squat was okay, distracted at first by people on rack and new
Oly lifter. Rack okay, need to stay back more on ascent, keep back tight.

Press was tiring, presumably upper body tired from backpacking.

Deadlifts were pretty good. First two sets set up too low, last set was better. Back
feels like it's horizontal, but lift goes much more smoothly. Nice pump on forearms.

Gave up on chinups, completely ran out of steam.

### Notes

Pretty good day. Kept squats light, to work on form. Main insight is to think about
tightening up back at the top, then during the actual motion, concentrate on the hips to
get into the hole correctly.

Press easy, gripping the bar well. Also chest up while keeping core tight was well.

Power cleans feel very light. Form not perfect, but can progress. Main thing to focus on
is chest up and tensioning the arms so that all weight is on the traps.

Dips easy.

Slightly less rest on curls, to get pump.

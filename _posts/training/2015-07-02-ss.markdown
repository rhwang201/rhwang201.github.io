Squat       :   225x5x3

Bench       :   220x3

Deadlift    :   375x5

Chinup      :   60x5,4,4

### Notes

Summin' ain't right. Despite solid sleep, everything felt extraordinarily heavy today.
This might have been up there for one of my worst workouts. Squat was okay, though, as it
is still light. Need to stay on mid-foot.

Bench sucked, last rep was a struggle.

Deadlift sucked, was pausing between each rep.

Chins were a struggle.

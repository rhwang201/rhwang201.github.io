Power clean :   185x3x3

Press   :   122.5x5,5,4

Squat   :   205x5x3

Chinup  :   65x5x3

### Notes

Got the booster yesterday, so wasn't feeling great. Cleans fine, can probably progress. Doubles? Some reps still catching forward

Press pretty good actually, just not enough in the tank

Squats mostly good, staying upright and tight

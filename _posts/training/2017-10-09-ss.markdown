Squat       :   230x5x3

Bench       :   205x5,4,4,4

Deadlift    :   295x5

Chinup      :   55x5,4,4,4;25x7

Lateral Raise   :   22.5x7x3

### Notes

Squats weren't great to be honest. Maybe need a bit more time to warm up. Keep
shoulders/neck relaxed and down. Neutral weight over foot, squat down, torso tight.

Bench okay, difficult to go hard without a spotter.

Alternate grip on deads, back/traps pretty tired.

Squat : 220x5x3

Power clean : 180x2x3

Machine bench : 55x10x3

Pallof press  : 35x10x3

Box jump  : 105cmx3x3

Side external rotation  : 2.5x18x3

### Notes

Squats pretty hard. Okay, but looks uneven in mirror. Decent bounce and back position though. Maybe repeat

Cleans hard, form sloppy. A good rep here and there, but meh overall. Could repeat

Good pump on bench

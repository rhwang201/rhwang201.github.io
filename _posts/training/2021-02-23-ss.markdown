Power snatch :   105x3x3

Push press   :   130x3x3

Squat   :   210x5x3

Dip     :   60x5x3

### Notes

Good day, snatches were solid. Make sure arms aren't too locked out though and swinging bar away from you. Would be good to progress

Still getting push press form down, kinda jerked on rep I think haha. Not bad though

Squat was good, thinking about bracing 360degrees of core. Would start repeating now

Dips very easy

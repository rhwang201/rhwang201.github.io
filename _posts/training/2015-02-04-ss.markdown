Squat       :   125x5x5

Bench       :   200x5x3

Back Extension : 25x10x5

### Notes

Squats were meh...Still not sitting in hole correctly. Rack seems a bit better
though. Worked a bit on stretching hip flexors at end of workout.

Bench wasn't bad! Did banded distraction for shoulder before. Last rep was
hard, had to bounce too much for it...Fatigue caught up.

Skipped chins because I was reading PP this morning and thought I needed more
rest haha.

Should take a break from back extensions too.

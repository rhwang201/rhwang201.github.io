### Notes

Hung over again lol. Cleans were abysmal, body was just not having it. Repeat 190 assuming you rest well? Also, in general feel free to shift your schedule so you're not lifting when dead lol.

Press not there, repeat

Squats good, can hopefully do 230 on Thursday. Back felt tight and upright

Mistakenly did dips with chinup weight lol, that's why it was so easy

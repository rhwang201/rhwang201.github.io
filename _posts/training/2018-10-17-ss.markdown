Squat       :   205x5x3;185x5

Bench       :   175x5x3

Deadlift    :   275x5

Pullup      :   30x5x3

Prowler     :   45x6;0x2

### Notes

A lot better today than Monday, as expected. Squats a lot better. Knees more forward,
while still keeping weight over midfoot, seems like engaging posterior chain more. Breath
into belly!

Bench easy.

Deads easy, still with good setup (not moving shins too far forward).

First time doing prowler! Fun and challenging.

Squat : 205x5x3

Press  : 122.5x5,5,4

Pullup  : 70x5,5,4

Incline dumbbell press : 50x14x3

Incline curl  :  25x9x3

Lateral raise : 15x15x3

### Notes

Maybe too heavy for squats, back hurts a little.

Press felt good

Controlled on bodybuilding stuff. Feels nice to think of the contraction, especially on lateral raises.

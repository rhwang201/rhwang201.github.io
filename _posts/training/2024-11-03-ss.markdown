Squat : 200x5x3

Press  : 122.5x5,4,4

Pullup  : 75x5,4,4

Incline dumbbell press : 50x15,15,12

Incline curl  :  17.5x13x3

Lateral raise : 10x15x3

### Notes

Squats okay, though a little uneven on the ascent. Maybe reset?

Press and pullup a bit heavy, especially with new equipment

Incline fine, good stretch. Make sure you're getting full ROM at the top.

Good stretch on curls, I like the lower weight on lateral raises.

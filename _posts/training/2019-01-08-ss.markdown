Run         :   1 mile 6mph, 1 mile 8mph, 1 mile 8.5mph, 0.5mile 10mph

Bench       :   175x5x3

Deadlift    :   330x1

Pullup      :   25x6x3

### Notes

Running is a lot better, the "fast" miles were "easy".

Oops, probably should've pushed a little more on bench.

Should not do deadlifts on run days. Glutes don't feel good.

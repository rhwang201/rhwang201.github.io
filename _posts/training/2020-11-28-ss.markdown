Power snatch :   85x3x3

Bench   :   145x5x3

Squat   :   185x5x3

Dip     :   55x5;45x4,3

### Notes

Still recovering, obviously, from wisdom teeth and rib. Surfed in the morning too and backcountry the day before, so pretty tired. Snatch okay, less bang, more brush.

Bench fine, though unracking irritates the rib cage a little

Squat good. "Screw in your feet", big breath, form was great actually

Too heavy on dips, ego man.

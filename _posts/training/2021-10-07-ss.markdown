Snatch :   95x3x3

Push press  : 125x3x3

Front squat   :   185x3x3

Dip      :   65x5x3

### Notes

Snatch good, still catching kinda high. Let's progress. Arm bend/row looks okay in the mirror. Also good job with running shoes

Push press good, doing a good job with jerk racks. Careful on the way down, choking yourself out, maybe a bit slower/more controlled

Front squat fine, progress

Dips challenging but got it. Stay controlled on the bounce

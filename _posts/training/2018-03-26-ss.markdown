### Notes

Not a bad day. Definitely stiff all over the place from not having lifted for a while.
Squats not bad, focused on "squatting" (knees forward) at beginning, and then locking
knee position in place during the hole. Focus on maintaining back angle on ascent.

Press was strong! Went conservative, and it went well. Fingerprints in the bar, chest up,
abs tight.

Power cleans pretty good. Weight on the heels after the knee.

Dips okay.

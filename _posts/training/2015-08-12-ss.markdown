Press       :   110x5x5

Dip         :   0x15,15,13

Facepull    :   40x12x2

### Notes

Skipped squats to rest lower back. Press was easy, big breath.

Dips were good, focused on adequate depth. First set not that great, but groove was
greased for subsequent sets.

Leaning back a lot to balance weight for face pulls?

Clamshells, fire hydrants, goblet squat weighting right side, couch stretch

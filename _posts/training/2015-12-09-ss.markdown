Squat       :   185x5x3

Press       :   105x5x3

Facepull    :   40x12x3

Dip         :   0x10x3

Curl        :   22.5x9x3

### Notes

Slept 8 hours. Squat was okay, maybe half the reps were pauses. Rack is better, found the
spot under the traps. Sitting into hole not that great, had to shove ass back. Also, some
weird lateral pressure on knee.

Did presses from bottom for the hell of it.

Pull higher for facepulls. Be willing to internally rotate shoulders.

Tired dips.

### Notes

Not a great day. Snatch form still meh, probably need to take a form day. Heavy rowing
once you get past the knees, not opening hips progressively.

Cleans okay (keep the bar closer to the leg), but definitely a little heavier than
before, tweaked lower back a bit.

Press was weak, also unmotivated in general.

Light day for squats, technique.

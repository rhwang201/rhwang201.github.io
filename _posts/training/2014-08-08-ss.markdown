Press:          120x5x3

Deadlift:       245x5 

Chinups

### Notes

Press was okay, last rep was kind of difficult. Keep core tighter. Consider
moving to 2.5lb jumps now.

Deadlift was okay. Take all the slack out of your arms.

Introduced myself to two Crossfitters are the gym today, they seem nice.

Pain in left thigh (IT?) while biking still present. Will try to rest it this
weekend.

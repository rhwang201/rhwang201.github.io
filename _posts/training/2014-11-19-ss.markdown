Squat:          230x5x3

Press:          130x5x3

Dip:            40x12,9,9

### Notes

Squat rack was much improved, but still a nuisance afterwards. Squats looked
pretty good, just need to be more disciplined about a _tight_ bounce at the
bottom. For the rack, I focused on pulling weight down onto back. Perhaps need
to set the bar a bit higher, and keep elbows/upper back more tight.

Press was okay, a bit hard. I could feel the after effects of the crappy
rack...My weak point is near the top at lockout. Focused a lot on keeping abs
tight, which seemed to help today.

Skipped deadlifts to let cut heal.

Dips were crappy because of squat rack. Felt kind of pain in biceps on
eccentric portion. Without a good descent, they were pretty hard.

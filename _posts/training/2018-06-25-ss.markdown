### Notes

Not a bad day, despite suboptimal recovery this weekend. Squats were once again
acceptable, but not quite there. Can progress, but slowly. Need to do a better job of
sitting tightly into the hole.

Bench was good-ish! Got a spot from David, those sets were so much better and tighter and
in the slow.

Deads were too hard, drop the weight. Tough on lower back.

### Notes

Pretty good day. Not enough sleep over the weekend, really felt it today. Squat form took
a while to warm up. Wasn't perfect, some reps were good. Good job keeping weight on back.
Don't collapse back while in hole.

Press easy, good.

Cleans not bad, keep a more vertical back for jumping position.

Dips hard, but not a bad job.

Good pump on curls (in a rush, short rest).

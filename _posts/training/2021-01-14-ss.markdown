Dip : 75x5x3

Box Jump   :   110cmx3x5

Pistol  :   0x5x5

Turkish Get Up   :   35x3x3

### Notes

Started off with snatch practice, just the bar. Think you need to stay a bit more over the bar, ie back more horizontal. Good upward movement though

Dips were hard but good. Can probably progress

Box jumps pretty good, easier to commit when using boxes and not a plate. Can progress. Also commit to forward horizontal motion to land properly

Supersetted pistols and TGU's were tiring but fine

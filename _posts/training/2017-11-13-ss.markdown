### Notes

Pretty good day. Keeping back tight, chest up. Back angle constant through most of squat.

Press was tough, keep the bar closer, even after it passes the head.

Power cleans okay, last set was good when it was go time. Keep back tight, chest up,
explode at top and get under the bar.

Grip was a bit messed up on dips (slippery bar), but not bad.

Start to do abs again.

Squat       :   225x5x3;185x5

Bench       :   220x2x3;175x7

Deadlift    :   295x5;255x5

Lateral Raise   :   22.5x10x3

### Notes

Kept squat light, which was probably a good decision. Start sitting "down", helps with
hip drive.

Bench okay, left side lagging a bit.

Deads a lot better! Didn't even alternate grip. Using back a whole lot better now,
especially the lats near the lower part of the scapula.

Chinups were weak, maybe because of deads.

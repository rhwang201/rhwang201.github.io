Squat : 200x5x3

Press  : 122.5x4x3

Incline dumbbell press : 50x13x3

Incline curl  :  15x15x3

Lateral raise : 10x17x3

### Notes

Got squats, but I think too heavy. Lower back feels tweaked. Reset

Press was weakened because of squats I think. Otherwise not bad.

Everything else fine. A little distracted at home

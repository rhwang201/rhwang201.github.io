### Notes

Pretty good day. Got motivated by this guy power cleaning 255 in front of me...You should
eat more. Squats were good, focused on "bar back", and sitting into the hole. Set the
pelvis, and take a big breath.

Press easy, abs sore from Monday.

Power cleans...okay. It's okay to go more slowly in the bottom. Be sure to setup the
"jumping" position correctly. The back should be more vertical.

Dips very easy.

Curls good, pushed through.

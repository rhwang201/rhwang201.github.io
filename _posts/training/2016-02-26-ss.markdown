Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   205x4

Chinup      :   75x3

Dip         :   100x2

### Notes

Still not enough sleep. Squat wasn't bad actually. Taking time to warmup helps. Sticking
chest super up for rack. Practicing spikes in between sets, not the best idea for upper
body afterwards.

Failed last bench rep.

Chins good.

Dips first rep is pretty bad, but second easy. Take time to set on first rep and stay
tight.

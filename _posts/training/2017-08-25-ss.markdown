### Notes

Last day of cutting. Still not sleeping well, was very tired for workout. Squats were
meh.

Bench was okay.

Not enough energy for deads, but not bad.

Decent ROM on chins.

Not decent ROM on lateral raises.

Good pump on cable extensions.

Intervals getting faster (went up to "12" for 30 seconds).

Swing, on knee tucks.

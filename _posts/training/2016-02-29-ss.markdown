Squat       :   205x5x3

Press       :   125x5x5

Deadlift    :   295x5x3

Chinup      :   45x5x3,3x1;25x5

### Notes

Okay workout today, okay recovery over the weekend. Squat was okay, rack could be more
solid, back could be more tight.

Abs should be more tight on press, but overall, not bad.

Had to alternate on deads for last two sets.

Biceps tired on chins.

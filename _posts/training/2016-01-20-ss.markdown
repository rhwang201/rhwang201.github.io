Squat       :   135x5x5

Bench       :   155x5x3

Back Extension  :   25x14x3

Facepull    :   40x12x3

### Notes

Boring, light day. Squat sucks. While doing pauses, I figured out I'm very _forward_ in
the hole. Need to get positioning there back.

Bench was whatever.

Back extensions good, got a pump. Maybe more control/pause at top, though.

Facepulls good

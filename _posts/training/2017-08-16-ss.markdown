### Notes

First day at new gym. Not much sleep, not much food. Dropped weight on squats to focus on
form. In addition to sticking ass back, think about keeping bar weight back (ie over
mid-foot). Did pauses at end.

Close grip bench. Did pauses at end.

Ego-deadlift. Was hard, and lower back a bit uncomfortable.

Chins were easy.

Stairs were hard.

Keep on doing abs, lol.

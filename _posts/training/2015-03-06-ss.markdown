Squat       :   195x5x3

Press       :   150x3

Chinup      :   0x10,10,6

### Notes

Moved squat back to 3x5 for form and since it's getting *heavier* again. Not
bad today, although back angle varied a bit. Bar position on back is better but
not back to great yet.

Press was hard, but just about what I expected, to be honest.

Chins were cool.

Couch and squat.

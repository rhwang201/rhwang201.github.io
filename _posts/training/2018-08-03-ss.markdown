### Notes

Overall, good day! Squats were tiring, but overall good. Good job staying tight and
keeping knees tight. Main thing to stay aware of is keeping torso tight and full of air.

Press was hard, also good job. Keeping the legs straight and tight helps.

Power cleans overall good. Need to jump more "back". And be sure to rack the bar fully.

"Maxed" out on dips! Was pretty easy. Anterior shoulders definitely limiting here.

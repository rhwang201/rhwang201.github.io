Power clean :   195x3x3

Press   :   127.5x3x3

Squat   :   235x5x3

Chinup  :   65x5x3

### Notes

Cleans okay, definitely racking low. Also probably contacting low on the leg. Repeat

Press no bueno. Left shoulder still doesn't feel great. Probably reset/help the shoulder recover.

Squats okay, definitely some good morning'ing, but also keeping bar over midfoot. Repeat

Chins good, last rep was almost not there. Could progress or repeat

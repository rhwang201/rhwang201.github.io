### Notes

Didn't sleep or eat enough yesterday, but had an extra day. Low back does not seem to be
in good condition. Rack was a bit lower than usual, elbows lower, lats tighter (?).
Wasn't too tight, but no pain...

Press was easy and good.

Deads were pretty good actually. Kept hips high, back tight.

Failed chins again, was rushing by this point.

Added volume bench per Deng. Really pumped by this point.

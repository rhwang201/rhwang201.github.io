Power clean :   180x3x3

Press   :   120x5,4,4

Squat   :   215x5x3

Chinup  :   60x5x3

### Notes

Power cleans not bad (though was probably trying to show off a bit). Some receives uneven/not very strong. Probably repeat once more, practice keeping the bar close after the knee

Press not very noteworthy, just not super strong.

Squats pretty good, need to keep weight a bit more towards the heels. Can progress.

More limited ROM on chins. Can progress, prob won't get much further

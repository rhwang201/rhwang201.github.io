Power clean : 175x3x2, 180x3

Incline dumbbell press : 55x12,12,9

Pallof press  : 42.5x11x3

Facepull  : 72.5x13x3

Shoulder press  : 40x13,13,15

Low to high:  13x12x3

### Notes

Clean form was okay. Warm ups no good, though working set alright. Meet the bar, stop cutting your warmup reps short

Right shoulder felt bad for incline (was first exercise), be careful

Everything else easy. Low to high numbers fake, used a different machine

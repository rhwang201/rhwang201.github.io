Power snatch :   100x3x3

Bench   :   165x5x3

Squat   :   190x5x3

Dip     :   60x5x3

### Notes

Snatches alright. Rack still not perfect, also when you get fatigued think you're moving to the balls of your feet, causing you to jump forward. Stay on the tripod the entire time. Okay to progress

Bench alright, not super easy, left side lagging a bit I think.

Squat good, no knee pain. Tripod, big breath, tight back.

Rushed dips, but got it

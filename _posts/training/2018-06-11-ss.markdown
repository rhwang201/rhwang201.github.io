### Notes

Okay day. Not the best recovery this weekend, slept a lot Sunday night. Squats not bad,
start thinking about the "slot" and keeping the weight back while going down. Keep on
doing the bounce.

Bench was okay. Wish I had a spotter. Left side definitely has a tendency to lag.

Deads were alright, had to alternate for the last two reps. Warm up sets were great. Good
job "compacting" the back, and letting weight fall to traps.

Limited ROM on chins, pretty tired.

Power snatch :   95x3x3

Squat   :   175x5x3

Dip  :   45x5x3

Cable row :   37.5x12x3

### Notes

Rib cage getting better! Probably too heavy for snatch. Jumping forward a bit on snatch, not receiving it in a strong position. Makes sense, haven't had form practice in a while

Squat fine, big breath, stay tight at the bottom

Forget the exact number for cable row, it was one for each arm

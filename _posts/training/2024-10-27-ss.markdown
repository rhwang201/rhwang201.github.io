Squat : 195x5x3

Press  : 120x5x3

Pullup  : 75x5,5,4

Incline dumbbell press : 50x15,15,14

Incline curl  :  17.5x12x3

### Notes

Squats fine, hips a bit tight.

Press challenging, but got it.

Pullup hard, incline got a good stretch, good pump on curls. Lateral raises felt a bit better with lighter weight.

Power clean  :  180x3x3

Press : 125x5,5,4

Pullup  :  25x9,9,8

Lateral raise : 17.5x17x3

Pallof press  : 50x17x3

Facepull  : 65x14x3

### Notes

Cleans meh. Make sure to pull slowly off the floor; not bad if you do that. Let's do 185x2x3. Really go slow off the floor

Press not bad, can give it one more shot

Got distracted on last pullup set

Repeat lateral raise?

Can repeat pallof, with a bit longer hold/contraction

### Notes

Definitely a caloric deficit this weekend. Stop doing that. If you want to get ripped,
add in some high intensity stuff (sports) rather than forget about meals. Squats were
pretty good, bar is back on the back (rather than arms). Mostly stayed back.

Press was pretty solid. Tough on the abs at times.

Dips were meh.

Incline curls got a good pump going.

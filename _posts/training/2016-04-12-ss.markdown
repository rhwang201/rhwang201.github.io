Squat       :   185x10x3

Bench       :   175x7x2,10x1

Dip         :   35x10,7,7

### Notes

Didn't get a full night's rest, but not too bad. Squats were tiring, form was okay. Rack
not right, but mostly even in the hole. Pelvis slightly improved, still could squeeze abs
harder.

Bench whatever. Slowed down and kept it more control after spotter told me to do so on
first rep.

Dips whatever.

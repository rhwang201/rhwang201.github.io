Snatch :   100x3,3,2

Push press  : 130x3x3

Front squat   :   200x3x3

Dip      :   75x5,5,4

### Notes

Sleepy this morning. Snatch a lot better, but couldn't get last set, probably not enough endurance. Getting under the bar _a lot_ faster, overhead position also pretty strong

PP alright, form not perfect.

FS alright

Dips challenging

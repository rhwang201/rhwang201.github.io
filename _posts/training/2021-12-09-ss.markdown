Clean : 195x3x3

Overhead Squat  : 125x3x3

Box jump : 105cmx5x3

Pullup  :  45x6x3

### Notes

Cleans good finally, even though technically it was more weight (kg)? Maybe new equipment attitude haha. Good focus on the clean itself, rather than the squat. Progress

OHS okay, not perfect but good focusing on strength

Box jumps good too, "cheated" the landings but they were all good (no mats for 107cm)

Pullups easy

Tricep extensions 22.5x15x3

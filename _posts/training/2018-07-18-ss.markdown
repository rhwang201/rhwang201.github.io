### Notes

Didn't sleep great last night, but not a bad workout. Main insight from squats is:
actually do work. In other words, _legs_ should be tight, don't only think about torso.
Think you've been being lazy...

Bench easy.

Deads good. "Short" back, pushing through the heels.

Switched it up with pullups, they were good.

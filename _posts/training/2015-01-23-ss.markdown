Back Extension: 0x10x3

### Notes

Press was pretty good! Abs were tight, bar was well balanced. Should get 135
easily next time.

Deads went up, but working set was meh. Was  supposed to do 315... I think I'm
going to reset and focus on form. Once again, weight is not entirely on traps,
back is not as tight as it should be.

Dips were deeper this time! Go a tiny bit deeper.

Lower back was blasted, with just bodyweight. I did the one second hold between
reps and a ten second hold at the end of each set. Let's see how the back feels
tomorrow.

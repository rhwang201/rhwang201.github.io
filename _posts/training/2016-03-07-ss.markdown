Squat       :   215x5x3

Bench       :   195x5x5

Deadlift    :   315x5x3

Dip         :   55x5x4,4

### Notes

Slept extra less night to try to recover from continual deficit. Woke up tired, no
coffee. Squat really isn't that great; mobility issues at the bottom. Rack wasn't bad
though, despite it feeling too low on the rear delts.

Good bench. Started off shitty because of different spotter. Really composed myself and
squeezed hard during later sets though.

Deads hard. Grip, even alternate, is tiring. Weight was too far forward at first.

Pooped by dips (workout was taking longer today, so kind of rushing by this point).
Missed last rep (what!).

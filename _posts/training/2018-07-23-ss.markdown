Squat       :   195x5x3

Bench       :   195x5x3

Deadlift    :   255x5

Pullup      :   50x5x3

Lateral Raise   :   22.5x10x5

### Notes

Not a bad day. Squats are...better. Rack could still be improved. Don't forget neutral
pelvis. Can increase carefully.

Bench is good, but hard.

Deads were really good actually! Weight on the heels, back engaged well.

Chins good.

Squat       :   165x5x5

Press       :   125x5x53

Pullup      :   0x10,8,6

Back Extension : 25x10x3

### Notes

Squats were good today. I (for once) had some fire in me today, and needed to
let out some frustration, which led to tightness yay. Cues I focused on were
'breathe into lower back' and 'sit down'.

Press was pretty good. Gripped the bar tightly, kept abs tight.

Pullups not too noteworthy, ROM at top not too good.

Back extensions good.

Hip flexor mob.

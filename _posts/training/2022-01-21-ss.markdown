Overhead Squat  : 130x3x3;115x3x3

Bulgarian Split Squat : 45x9x3

Pullup  : 45x6x3

Woodchopper : 22.5x9x3

Box jump  : 107cmx3,2;105cmx3


### Notes

OHS okay, definitely a point in the middle that's wobbly. Tried to do pauses for the lighter sets, but they weren't great. Keep on working at it

BSS fine

Probably reset box jumps

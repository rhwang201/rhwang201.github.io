Squat       :   230x5x3

Power Clean :   165x3x5

Dip         :   90x5,4,3;70x5


### Notes

Skied hard yesterday. Squats are okay, but really not passing. Go a bit lighter, make
sure working set form is good. Sit into hole with hips, keep weight (and neck) back.

Press alright, but hard.

Going into full cleans. Don't shrug early.

Dips easy.

Snatch  : 95x3x5

Pullup  : 45x5x3

Squat :   240x5,5,4

Dip     :  55x5x3

Box Jump   :   105cmx3x5

### Notes

Snatch okay, missing reps here and there due to a weak rack. I think you need to train OHS to actually get this right. Squat programming should be heavy back squats, OHS, light volume back squats

Failed squats again. Started out okay, just couldn't maintain three sets (lost tightness on one rep).

Dips super easy, jumps mostly good (just land forward on the box). can progress

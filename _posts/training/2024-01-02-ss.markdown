Deadlift  :  335x5

Bench : 170x8,8,7

Cable row : 160x11x3

Tricep extension  :  35x13,13,9

Lateral raise  :  22.5x17x3

Neck extension  :  15x14x3

### Notes

Happy new year

Bad recovery, I suppose. Torso still feels a little suspect on deadlifts...Could reset or repeat.

Everything else feeling weak-esque. Progress lateral raise and neck extension by one.

Squat       :   185x5x3

Bench       :   175x5x3

Deadlift    :   245x5

Chinup      :   25x5x5

### Notes

First day back into a schedule! Squats were okay, improved after first set. Remember to
brace abs hard, and keep ass back while in hole.

Bench was okay, keep it even and squeeze the bar.

Kept deads light, did a dropoff at 225.

Last rep of chins were hard.

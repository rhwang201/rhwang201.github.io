Squat       :   185x5x3

Bench       :   185x5x5,6x1

Dip         :   45x8x2,6x1,4x1

### Notes

First time lifting in over a week, with Coachella and sickness. Hip mobility sucks, was
feeling super tired from Yosemite. Squats were whatever. Right hip and knee was cracking
at first. Should be careful with back.

Bench wasn't bad actually when I squeezed hard.

Dip was fun but hard.

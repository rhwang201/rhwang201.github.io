Deadlift  :  225x5

Bench : 155x11x3

Cable row : 160x10x3

Dip  :  80x5,5,4

Lateral raise  :  17.5x10x3

Rear delt cable fly : 15x14x3

### Notes

Deads okay, going light because of back

Bench good.

Barely getting rows, change it up?

Dips hard but good

Lateral raise and rear delt feel good. Mind body connection + warmup

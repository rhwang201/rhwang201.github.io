### Notes

Pretty good day, despite being sleepy and not eating enough! Squats were a lot better.
"Angle" wrists to get weight on the back prior to unracking. For some reason, it was
a lot easier to set the back/trunk today (maybe because of rack?). Focused on hips and
staying back. Also started thinking about the ascent, to regain that stretch reflex.
I think that actually helped me to stay tight in the hole!

Bench was pretty good. Hard, but kept it fast, holding breath for four reps.

Deads were okay, used chalk. Need to remember to keep weight on traps, ie shoulders down.

Some chins had short ROM.

Some lateral raises had short ROM.

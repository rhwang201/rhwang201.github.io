Power snatch :   115x3x3

Bench   :   180x5x3

Squat   :   235x5x3

Dip     :   80x4,4,3

### Notes

Snatches alright, warmups and first couple sets had bad technique. Get tighter and attack those. Last set was pretty good though. Repeat

Bench fine, can progress.

Squats hard, definitely a bit of good morning-ing. Repeat

Reset on dips

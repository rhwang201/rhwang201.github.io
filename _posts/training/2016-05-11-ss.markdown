Press       :   105x7x3

Deadlift    :   275x5x3;225x7

Facepull    :   45x12x5

### Notes

Slept deeply last night, coffee woke me up this morning. Chest and shoulders wrecked from
Monday. Even more fatigued from press.

Deadlifts back in the mix, thanks to shitty squat. They weren't that bad. Kept the bar on
the legs for the latter sets. Mostly over midfoot.

Probably cheating a bit on facepulls, but whatever.

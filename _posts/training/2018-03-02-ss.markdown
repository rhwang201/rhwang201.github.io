### Notes

Okay day. Felt pretty strong, but some form concerns. Squats started off okay, but
deteriorated with fatigue. Really not settling into or coming out of hole correctly
(shifting forward), flexibility might be making it harder? Don't increase weight.

Press was good. Fingerprints in the bar, kept abs tight.

PC was ehhh. No speed, awkward second pull.

Dips pretty good, bit more of a lean.

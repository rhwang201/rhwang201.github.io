### Notes

Not a bad day. Rode to work, so took a while to warmup. Bench felt super light at first,
so I wasn't being very tight. Did pauses on drop off to calm it down.

Deadlift not bad at times, really need to make sure I'm back on my heels.

Dips were _strong_. Set of 10 was cake.

Curls were fun, think I actually chose good weight, reps.

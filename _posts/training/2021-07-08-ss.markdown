### Notes

Snatch not bad. Noticed in video the rowing after the knee, focused on opening up hip angle instead. Can progress

OHS pretty good, can progress

Dips pretty good but hard, repeat

Snatch pull complex. 1 slow, 1 slow pull, 1 pull. Focused on opening up hip after knee

Chins fine

Repeat box jumps, not committing, using hands

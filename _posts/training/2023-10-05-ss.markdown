Power clean  :  185x2x4

Dip  :  95x5,5,4

Chinup  :  25x9x3

Pallof press  : 50x17x3

Facepull  : 65x15x3

### Notes

Cleans fine, inconsistent. Slow off the floor, higher contact, drive vertically, think "up".

Decent form on dips, repeat. Don't get too loose in the hole

Switched to chins

Figure out what to do next with pallofs? Lower weight, more control?

Also did 35lbx15x3 step down thingys. Slope thing + one step up thing

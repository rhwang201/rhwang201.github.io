Squat       :   190x5x3

Bench       :   230x2

Deadlift    :   365x5,275x8

### Notes

Box squats, not bad. Some reps sat back more, some reps sat down. A little
slow...

Not the best spot, so only went for two. Not bad, a little slow.

Deads were _hard_. Might need smaller jumps and/or a form check.

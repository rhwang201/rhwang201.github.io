### Notes

Alright day. Went lighter on squats, they were okay. Using more of posterior chain,
thought "chest up" pretty hard. Can still be a bit more balanced over midfoot throughout
movement.

First heavy set was good for press, but only got that one.

Pretty much full cleans. Was hitting high on the thigh in warmups, but not working sets.

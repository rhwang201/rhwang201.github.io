Squat       :   205x5x3

Press       :   125x5x3;105x7

Power Clean :   155x3x5

Dip         :   75x5x3


### Notes

Not a bad day. Squats aren't great though, shouldn't increase weight. Not doing "down,
then back", also need to hold bigger breath.

Press pretty good! Tight trunk while moving under bar. Last set hard.

Power cleans meh, jerked a bit with arms.

Dips good, last rep hard.

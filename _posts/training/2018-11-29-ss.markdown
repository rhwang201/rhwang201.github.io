Squat       :   215x5x3

Press       :   145x1x3;115x5

Power Clean :   185x1;195x2

Dip         :   135x1;45x10


### Notes

Good day overall. Squats weren't great; uneven laterally (rotating counter-clockwise,
from bird's eye view), bar path isn't vertical.

Press pretty good.

Power cleans not bad! Don't know how to rack heavier weights though. Maybe practice
sometime?

Dip good.

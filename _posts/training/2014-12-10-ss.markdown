### Notes

Been sleeping pretty well recently.

Not yet in a sweet spot for balance in the squat. Rack is also a bit off,
brusing skin over right scapula a bit.

Got press. I think core could be tighter. Don't be afraid to lean back more,
and you _really_ need to get under the bar more.

Keep the bar back and on the legs more for deads. Push through heels for more
efficient movement.

First rep on dips always feels crappy for some reason. Didn't push myself very
hard...

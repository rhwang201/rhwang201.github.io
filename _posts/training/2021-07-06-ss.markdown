Power clean :   195x3x3

Squat   :   235x5x2;225x5

Snatch pull : 135x3x3

Snatch balance : 95x3x3

Chinup  :   65x5,5,4

### Notes

Cleans pretty good, getting height for all of them. Sweep the bar into the leg, to maintain closeness during second pull. Can advance

Skipped presses, left shoulder still feeling funky during warmups. Let's still do light push movements, to help it heal

Squats a bit too heavy, good morning'ing. Probably do 230.

Snatch pulls good, complex with pause, slow, and real pull. Learning to actually do the second pull, rather than row the bar

Snatch balances pretty good, one OHS then two balances.

Missed last chin rep

Squat       :   225x5x3

Bench       :   195x5x3

Power Clean :   135x3x5

### Notes

For the first time, I willingly and deliberately took a light day. Focused
a lot on squat form, mainly maintaining a tight trunk. Some weird lower back
joint feelings though, as well as a bit of elbow aggravation. Hope I'm ready
for Friday.

Bench was hard. Climbing last night definitely did not help haha. Was a bit
unbalanced, had to bounce a lot on the last rep.

...I might quit cleans. I don't know how to do the second pull, my jumping
position is off, the bar swings away from my body. I actually just did some
hang cleans today.

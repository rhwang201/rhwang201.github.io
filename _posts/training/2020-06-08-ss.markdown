### Notes

Snatch form is not great. Take a technique day. Snatch pulls are fine, but for full
movement, you keep on rowing. Cleans fine, but also doing the shrug thing after the
knees.

Finally pushed a little and got the press. It's okay to lean back a bit as long as you're
tight.

Squats alright...

Second set for OHS always not great.

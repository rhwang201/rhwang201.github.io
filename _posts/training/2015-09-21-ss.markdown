Squat       :   200x5x3

Bench       :   185x5x5

Back Extension  :   25x10x5

### Notes

Pretty strenuous backpacking, so sore and fatigued. Good workout regardless! Squats
weren't bad, but can definitely keep weight a bit more back. Set hips, good. Keeping hips
set also helps with tightness in the hole.

Bench was challenging, but got it. Wrist still a little tender. If you need a spot, just
ask for it dummy, you'll have better technique.

Rapid back extensions, probably about a minute reset in between sets.

Hip stretch, one leg hip extensions.

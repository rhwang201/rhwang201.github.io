### Notes

Rough recovery this weekend from drinking/wedding.

Squat fine, continue w/ 5lb jumps

Still star-fishing on power cleans. Maybe the wider bar is throwing you off...

Probably could've had bench, but wanted a spot. Feels a lot more dialed in. More aggressive back arch, experimenting with feet position a bit

Chins went to zero after the weekend I guess

Rows easy

Squat       :   215x5x3

Press       :   145x3

Chinup      :   100x1;105x1;0x10,8,6

### Notes

Once again, not the best sleep, but felt decently well rested this morning. Squat was
okay, a little distracted by this random guy. Rack was acceptable, position was not
consistent though. Reps where I set lumbar properly were good. Need to stay more on
midfoot (going forward).

Press was meh. Shoulders were decently tired.

Chinup PR woo! Dropoff bodyweight sets.

Squat       :   210x5x3

Press       :   130x5x3

Chinup      :   0x9,9,7

### Notes

Fuck. Squat sucks. Rack is bad (mild shoulder and elbow discomfort, on both
sides, but primarily right). Pretty major butt wink on first set. Shit.

Press luckily was easy. Felt strong.

Chins bleh.

Hip external rotators and squat.

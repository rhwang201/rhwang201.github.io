Press       :   155x1x3

Chinup      :   90x3

Dip         :   90x5

Back Extension  : 0x15x3

Face Pull   : 20x15x3

### Notes

A little hungry. No fire today...Press was okay. Triceps seem like limiting factor.

Chins were solid.

Dips were good!

Back Extensions were controlled, 20 second end pauses.

10 second end pauses for face pull, should learn how to actually do it.

Power clean :   190x2,2,1

Press   :   120x5,5,4

Squat   :   225x5x3

Chinup  :   60x5x3

### Notes

Volleyball tournament the day before, so fatigued/not recovered. Clean height actually wasn't that bad, just wasn't receiving. Did some technique work at 165. Can repeat

Press pretty good actually. Tight, just not enough in the tank, sticking point somewhere around your head.

Squats also pretty good, a lot of reps with an upright torso. Can repeat

Chins easy

Some curls for the gurls (22.5x9x3), ankle mobility looking pretty good

Squat       :   225x5x3

Bench       :   200x4x3

Deadlift    :   290x5

Chinup      :   60x5x3

Close-grip Bench    :   135x7x3

### Notes

Squats alright. Bodyweight form is a lot better (tuck the pelvis, knees don't move in
hole).

Bench really weak. Probably because not eating that much. Last rep, had help.

Deads good. Weight more back this time, because of better setup.

Squat       :   230x5x3

Bench       :   175x5x3

Pullup      :   0x10,10,6

Back Extension  :   10x12x3

Facepull    :   30x20x3

### Notes

Less sleep, but not too tired. However, was fucking starving, and that did not bode well
for beginning of workout. First squat working set sucked, aggravated left lower back.
Balanced it out a bit on later sets. I think right knee needs to go forward a bit, need
more weight on right foot.

Bench was whatever, really should be lighter you idiot.

Pullup form is not on par with chinup form.

Back extensions weren't noteworthy. 20second end pauses.

Facepulls were tiring. Less volume probably.

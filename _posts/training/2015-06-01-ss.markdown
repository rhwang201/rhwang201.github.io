Squat       :   225x5x3

Bench       :   205x5x5,5,4,3,3

Chinup      :   37x5x5x5

### Notes

Horrible recovery this weekend, woo. Was super hungover Sunday, didn't sleep well Sunday
night. Squat form was improved, though, despite strength sucking. Knees out, midfoot,
sitting down, tight back and lats. Might need a light day Wednesday.

No bench strength gah.

Chins were _hard_ too. Last rep had a bit of leg kick. Starting to take a bit more rest
(probably 2m 15s).

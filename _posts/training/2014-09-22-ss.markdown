Squat:      135xmeh

Bench:      185x5x3

Power Clean:   157.5x5x3

### Notes

Obviously in pretty bad form from Beyond. Squats sucked, I'm highly considering
just doing front squats for now so I can at least progress (hopefully...).
Bench was okay, getting hard, need to stay tighter. Power cleans were
surprisingly good! Just be careful with the left wrist.

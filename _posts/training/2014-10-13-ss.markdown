Front Squat:    200x5x3

Press:          132.5x5,4,3

Deadlifts:      275x5

Chinups:        35x7,6,5

### Notes

Did not sleep well last night. Front squat was okay, hip is cracking at bottom,
make sure you're tight. Taking a big breath helps _a lot_. Chest up hard.

Will need to reset press, today was not a good day.

Deadlifts were pretty good, grip was dead from rock climbing yesterday.

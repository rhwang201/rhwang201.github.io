Squat       :   235x5x3;195x5

Bench       :   215x3

Chinup      :   70x3

Press       :   95x8x3


### Notes

Not a bad workout! Didn't sleep enough, and have been sick, but felt good enough today.
Squats were good. Rack is a little messed up, I think trying to keep wrists straight will
help. Took descents slow and controlled. Thinking about the hips on the ascent helps
a lot.

Bench was strong! Technique a little off, but two out of three reps good.

(Neutral-grip) Chins were also strong.

Press was fun, got a pump.

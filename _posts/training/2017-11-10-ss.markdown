Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   215x3x3;185x7

Deadlift    :   275x5

Chinup      :   105x2x2;45x7

Lateral Raise   :   22.5x8x3

### Notes

Pretty good day (took the day off, so slept in). Squat not bad, rack a little suspect
though. Need to focus on keeping shoulders/scapula relaxed and down (ie, better bar
position on back _after_ unracking).

Bench was strong. Maybe could've even done sets of five.

Dead pretty good, keeping lats and back engaged.

Not full ROM on chinup second reps.

Tried doing some abs (cable crunch, leg lifts).

Pistol  :   0x3x4

Turkish Get Up   :   25x3x3

Box Jump   :   42inx3x3

Snatch     :   bar practice

Dual Cable Row  : 35x12x3

### Notes

Accessory day, let's see if it burns at all. Supersetted pistols and TGU, both not bad.

Box jumps solid too, better than I last remembered them (ie, not kneeing my elbow anymore)

Some form snatch practice with an empty bar, felt good. Need a wide grip, "brush" not "bang", elbows high

### Notes

Pretty good day. Squat form a lot beter. "Gripped" the floor with the feet, weight was
much more even. Body a lot tighter, knees were stable, stayed tight in and out of the
hole. Good job.

Press was good, kept abs tight mostly.

Power cleans were meh. Have some cuts near the left knee, so wasn't able to keep it close
to the leg. Keep the weight here.

Dips were good.

Oops, was supposed to do curls.

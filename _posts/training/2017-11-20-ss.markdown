### Notes

Numbers finally looking more respectable again. Squats were okay. Rack is probably too
low, as the bar is slipping down the back during sets. Look more forward, and use the
upper back tightness cue from deadlifting.

Bench was strong. Not perfectly even, but it was fast. First four reps in one breath.

Deads pretty good. Instead of chest up, cue'd keeping everything tight just up till the
base of the neck, which worked pretty good. In general, for deads, main priority should
be keeping back tight.

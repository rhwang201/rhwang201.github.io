Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   155x5x5

Back Extension      :   45x14x4

Facepull    :   45x14x4

### Notes

Eh day. Slept like a log, still a little tired. Squat wasn't great, rack regressed on
working set, _FIX THAT_. Staying balanced decently though on ascent. Need to make sure
tight in the hole. Starting to learn how to keep the back tight again.

Bench whatever

Back extensions are _good_. Going fast.

Facepulls hard.

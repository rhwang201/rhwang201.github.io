Clean : 185x2x5

Overhead Squat  : 130x3x3

Pistol  : 0x7x3

Dip   : 55x7,7,6

### Notes

A little fatigued from volleyball probably. Cleans felt a bit sloppy, not receiving cleanly, not balanced on front squat. Probably repeat weight

OHS okay, had a bit of the wiggles. Repeat

Pistols pretty good

Dips good

Stairs  : 35min

Dips    : 0x12x3

### Notes

Rib cage better but not 100%. Intensity 8 for stairs

Arms feel out of shape from dips, but they're a good exercise while I'm injured

Also messed around with the bar for clean pulls, snatch pulls, and squats. Probably a bad idea. Monitor and cut out/back if that's the case

Power clean :   175x3x5

Press   :   120x5,4,4

Squat   :   200x5x3

Chinup  :   50x5x3

### Notes

Cleans really easy, keeping upper back tight, staying over the bar, clean rack. Could probably progress

Press was hard, upper back fatigued (from bc?). Not bad though

A bit of right knee pain again in squats, but overall fine, can progress

A bit rushed for chins but good, can progress

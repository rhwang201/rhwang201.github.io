Squat       :   215x5x3

Press       :   145x2,2,1

Dip         :   115x1x3

Curl        :   22x5x10x3

### Notes

Meh. Squats were not good, to be honest. Pelvis not correct, loose at bottom, weight too
forward (on balls of the feet). Might have just been fatigued, should have noticed and
gone lighter.

Press was okay.

Dips were easy.

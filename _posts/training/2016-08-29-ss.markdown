### Notes

Rough recovery this weekend. Right shoulder fuqd up. Squat was okay. Need more chest up,
legs tight. Did some "ass-down" sets, seems to have helped a bit.

Press wasn't bad. Tricep pump.

Dips getting hard, getting light-headed on some reps. Some might not have been to depth
because of shoulder.

Back extensions were done quickly.

Good volume on curls.

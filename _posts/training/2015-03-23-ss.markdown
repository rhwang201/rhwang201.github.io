Squat       :   165x5x3,185x5x2

Bench       :   205x5x4,4x1,3x1

Deadlift    :   355x5,275x8

### Notes

Box squats still. Overall, less pain after the exercise. Rack is good. Focusing
on keeping right knee from sliding forward.

Bench was difficult, pushed really hard, missed the freaking last rep because
I pysched myself out. Made up for it with a separate set. Good job overall,
keep the bounce strong, stay Goku.

Deads were hard. Flipped my alternate grip for working set and it threw me off;
lower back might have been rounded...Drop-off set was exhausting.

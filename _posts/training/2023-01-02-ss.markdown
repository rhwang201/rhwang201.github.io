### Notes

Recovery pretty shit I think from the drinking, lack of sleep

Strained lower back on squats unfortunately. Careful there, and reset. Hard to tell from warm ups, but you had a feeling today you should've gone lighter

Press pretty hard, but okay-ish form. Feels pretty tight

Bench hard

Good weight for row. Did double pulley, with the single attachment.

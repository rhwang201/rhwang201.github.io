Squat       :   175x5x3

Bench       :   200x5x5

Chinup      :   55x5x3,4,3

### Notes

Not enough calories this backpacking weekend, obviously. Squats weren't bad actually,
though still a little irritation left hip. Sat back well. Some reps you were really
tight. Take each rep seriously.

Bench was good! Had a good spotter, so finally got to push myself. Got everything.
Bridged a little on last rep of fourth set, but corrected on fifth set.

Chins were hard, especially after expending the effort on bench. Not enough umph.

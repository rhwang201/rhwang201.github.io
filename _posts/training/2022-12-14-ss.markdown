Deadlift  : 320x5x3

Bench : 175x4x3

Chinup  : 70x5,4,4

Cable crossover : 40x11x3

Chest supported row : 45x12x3

Incline dumbbell bench  : 40x11x3

### Notes

Deads good. Warmups pretty bad, take them more seriously. Remember tripod foot, your weight is a bit too forward by default. Felt a lot more hamstrings when you adjusted, and it was easier

Bench was tough today. Also hit the pin on first set, just get rid of it

Chins also a struggle

Crossovers hard, actually crossing over now

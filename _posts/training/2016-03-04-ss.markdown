Squat       :   225x3x3

Press       :   145x2x3

Chinup      :   90x1x3

### Notes

Not the most sleep again, but felt okay. Squat wasn't bad, stayed over midfoot okay.
However, rack is clearly not good. Positioning not correct.

Press was pretty easy, core was mostly pretty tight.

Chins were easy, but a little rough on biceps.

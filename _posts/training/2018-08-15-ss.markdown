Squat       :   185x6x3

Bench       :   175x5x3

Deadlift    :   265x5

Pec Deck    :   100x10x3

### Notes

Squats were okay, focused on tucking the pelvis and "compacting" back (shoulders down).
Think pelvis still a little irritated afterwards though.

Bench good.

On deadlift working set, need to compact back more, specifically, put more tension on
traps.

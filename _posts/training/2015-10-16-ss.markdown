### Notes

Pretty good day! Took squat warmups seriously, focused on keeping rack and hips even.
A couple warm up sets, bar was really on top of rear delts. Find that position. Sat into
hole well, mostly tight on the way up. Minimal additional shoulder aggravation.

Press was okay, definitely assymetric now though. Torso leans to the right.

Deads were pretty good! I think working set, though, I still put hips too low. Good job
keeping the bar on your legs and your chest up. Remember now how to engage the lats.

Super-setted facepulls and hammer curls lol. Wrists still a little hurt but hammer curls.

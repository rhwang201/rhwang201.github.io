Power clean : 175x3x3

Incline dumbbell press : 55x13x3

Pullup  :  25x7x3

Lateral raise : 15x10x3

Pallof press  : 42.5x14x3

Facepull  : 72.5x16x3

### Notes

Cleans kinda rough. Back "short" and tight. Repeat. Make sure to finish the pull and rack.

Everything else fine. Lateral raises felt good. Maybe try kneeling for heavy facepulls?

### Notes

Started squatting again, but wasn't great. Reps at 135 sucked, but 95 were
okay... When I ghetto-ly set up the bar on my back with no rack, it feels okay,
but out of the rack, I feel like I'm stuck in the same neural patterns.

Gah press again. From this, I feel like my trunk is weak... Video looked better
than it felt. Let's switch to intermediate programming soon...

Dips were okay, pretty tired.

Unweighted squats for mobility are working I think.

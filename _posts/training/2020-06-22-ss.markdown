### Notes

Alright day, staying over the bar longer for snatch. Did a progression of sorts (pauses,
pulls, etc). Give the movement a shot.

Power cleans hard, but got it. Need to figure out programming now...

Press is harder than it should be...

Squats alright, similar to cleans, starts off good, end is sloppier.

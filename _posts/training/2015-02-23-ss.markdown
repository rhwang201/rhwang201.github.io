Squat       :   135x5x3

Bench       :   195x5x5

Deadlift    :   245x5x3,225x8

### Notes

Hip still fucked up. Kept squat super light, just for form.

Bench was pretty hard. Wasn't too serious for middle sets, needed to be more
tight and squeeze bar more.

Deads weren't bad actually. Need to grip bar tighter, and stick chest up more.

Rolled glutes, tspine, calves. Squat. Overhead.

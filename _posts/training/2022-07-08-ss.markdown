### Notes

Squats a little harder, form not perfect. Probably can do more knees forward, a bit faster in bounce.

Shoulder still not great. If today's workout really aggravated it, stop pressing movements for a bit

Deads easy. Clean complex of pull and clean. Can probably keep bar closer for second pull

Chins, box jump easy

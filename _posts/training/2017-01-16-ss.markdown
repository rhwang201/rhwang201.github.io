### Notes

First day back in the gym in a while. Holiday, so took my time in the gym, which was
really nice. Squats not facing the mirror, they were okay. Maybe a bit too heavy.

Bench was okay. Left side lagged. Pushed through though.

Deads pretty good.

Chins good. Did some wide-grip pullups at the end for volume.

Dumbell bench for volume.

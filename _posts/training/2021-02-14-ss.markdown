Power clean :   175x3x5

Press   :   115x5x3

Squat   :   195x5x3

Chinup  :   45x5x3

### Notes

Cleans were pretty hard, not as strong as I thought I'd be. Could repeat, or go to 180

Press was pretty good, and hard. Kept core tight, bar close, and force through the palms

Squats also not bad, was working core. Can probably do another 5lb jump

Last rep was barely there for chins

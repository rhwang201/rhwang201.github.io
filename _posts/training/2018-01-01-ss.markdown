### Notes

Happy New Year! Camped last night, so not the best recovery. Also, had a headache/was
lightheaded, I think from the smoke. Squats pretty good. On warmups, played with
explicitly keeping weight on the heels, which I think is good. Weight distribution
funkier during working set though. Look a more forward, rather than down; it seems to
help with keeping your weight back.

Bench good, though hard.

Deads good, keeping back tight, bar on the legs, and driving through heels.

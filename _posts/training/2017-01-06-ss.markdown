### Notes

Pretty good day actually! Last workout day before week-long ski trip. Squats felt like
upon unracking, yes. Rack is a bit better. Definitely can be loading posterior chain
better and keeping back tighter.

Press was okay, need to keep bar closer to face and over midfoot.

Dips were okay.

Wide grip bench for volume.

Curls good.

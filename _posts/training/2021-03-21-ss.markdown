Power clean :   185x3,2;175x3

Press   :   115x5x3

Squat   :   205x5x3

Chinup  :   50x5x3

### Notes

Cleans were abysmal, even off the floor felt really hard. Should've listened to body better. Maybe poor recovery? (Though other lifts were okay). Probably reset a bit...

Press was good, pretty strong.

Squats not bad, need to get the rhythm and bounce back (found it on the second set). Can progress

Chins fine

### Notes

First day back after the concussion. That and reading _Die With Zero_ really have you thinking about and starting to prioritize longevity.

Anyway, took most things light. Didn't feel 100% during the workout, but symptoms didn't get worse, which is good

Squat regressed the most (mobility)?

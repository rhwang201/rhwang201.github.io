Press       :   115x5x5

Dip         :   70x7x3;45x9

Curl        :   25x10x3

### Notes

Okay day. Squats are okay, but not yet acceptable. Remember, think of it in two
movements; initially, break at the knees, then eventually, bend at hips and load
posterior. In other words, the bottom of the hole is messed up.

Probably pussied out on press, but not bad. Be sure to fully lock out at top.

Dips were solid. Not listening to music helped turn it up.

Curls were whatever.

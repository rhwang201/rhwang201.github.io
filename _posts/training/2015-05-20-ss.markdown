Squat       :   225x5x3

Press       :   120x5x3

Pullup      :   0x11,8,6

### Notes

Got squat, no pain, but not satisfied. I think back was really tired from Monday. Wasn't
really tight in hole, back not as well set as it could have been. Hamstrings probably
were loosening. I would redo this weight Friday.

Upper body dead from Monday, but got press easy.

Remember to use a wider grip for pullups than chinups (duh).

Squat       :   205x5x3

Press       :   122.5x5,4,4

Power clean :   157.5x3x5

Dip         :   45x8,8,6

Curl        :   20x8x3

### Notes

Not a bad day. Squat form pretty good, though heavy. Remember chin down. Good job
"leaning" over. Think core is too weak here.

Press form good but hard. Held core well.

Cleans pretty good actually. Think on average your getting to the jumping position
better.

Squat       :   210x5x3

Press       :   120x5,4,3

Dip         :   40x5x5

Back Extension  :   0x11x3

### Notes

Meh day. Went to a show last night, so not that much sleep. Squat...isn't that good.
I think mobility is limited at bottom. Getting glute/pelvic pain again. Really need to
sit into hole correctly. Drop down lighter, spend more time warming up.

Press was really weak. Need to keep abs tight.

Dips were easy.

Finally have an actually horizontal back extension thing!

Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   185x5x3

Power Clean :   155x3x5

### Notes

Slept nearly 8 hours last night, but still felt very fatigued for the entire
workout. May need to step up recovery.

Squat is getting better! Focus on keeping the ass back.

Bench was okay, some reps had a bit too much bounce.

Need to learn how to get into proper jumping position for power clean. The bar
swings pretty far away from midfoot.

Squat       :   235x5x2;225x5

Bench       :   215x2

Chinup      :   65x1

### Notes

Fuck. Squat, which I thought wasn't bad, turned out bad. Having trouble keeping pelvis
and trunk solid, lower back definitely shifts on some reps. Furthermore, rack troubles
continue. Didn't seem that bad during, but intense elbow pain afterwards. Quarterbacking
might have pre-empted the pain. Need to go light and resolve these issues. Rack may be
too low.

Spotter assisted on both reps...sigh.

Pain during chin up.

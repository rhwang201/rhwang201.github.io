Snatch :   110x2,2,1

Push press  : 155x2,2,1

Front squat   :   225x2x3

Dip      :   75x5,5,4

### Notes

Rough day, sleepy and feeling rushed? Inconsistent snatches. Good height, good elbows, strong receive, but rarely all three together

Push presses were heavy

FS were heavy (maybe a bit on balls of feet for some reps)

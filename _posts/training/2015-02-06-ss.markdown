Press:          135x5x3

Deadlift:       185x5x5

### Notes

Squats were better today. Midfoot cue helps a lot. Knees need to go forward
before sitting back. Set the trunk, too, abs tight. Chest up helped with
tightness at bottom.

Got press, but last rep was horrific. Arms were really tired from bench. Need
to emphasize getting under the bar. Also, might have cut the movement short at
the top.

Threw in deads, as I didn't want to do upper body accessory. They weren't bad!
On the midfoot. Excitingly, by the end, I learned how to tightly grip the bar
and keep the weight on the traps.

Squat, shoulder socket, and couch pose for mobility.

Power clean :   145x3x5

Press   :   105x5x3

Squat   :   185x5x3

Cable row     :   50x7x3

### Notes

Probably went too heavy overall today, still recovering from wisdom tooth surgery.

Positions for cleans not great, though it wasn't hard.

Ribcage not 100% yet.

Should've been tighter in the hole for squats

### Notes

Squats okay, still getting used to lifting in shoes again. Remember to think about dropping cooch straight down, then triangle up

Bench fine, better as the sets went on. Squeeze tight, keep wrists straight, aim for nipples.

Power cleans meh. Starfishing, last rep had a bad rack. Tried setting back, _then_ thinking about shoulders over the bar

10lb increase for deads probably too aggressive

Press a little hard with the volume, chins easy

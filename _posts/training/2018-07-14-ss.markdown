Squat       :   175x5x3

Bench       :   190x5x3

Deadlift    :   245x5

Chinup      :   80x2x5

Lateral Raise   :   25x9x3

### Notes

Pretty good day actually. Kept squats light, form was a lot better. Tucked pelvis, and
kept weight back.

Bench was alright. Maybe cue to "spread the bar" to stay tighter in the hole.

Deads alright, finally pushing through heels.

Short rest for chins (since I was upset I could only do doubles).

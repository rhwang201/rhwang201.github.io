Squat : 215x5x3

Dumbbell press  : 50x12,12,9

Pullup  : 75x4x3

Incline dumbbell press : 60x13x3

Incline curl  :  22.5x12x3

Lateral raise : 20x17x3

### Notes

Really limited sleep, like 4 hours.

Squats felt pretty good, similar good form from screwing in feet. Could repeat or progress depending on recovery

Incomplete ROM on last pullup reps

ROM is getting pretty limited on inclines...Up to you, they're for hypertrophy, so could cheat or get more strict.

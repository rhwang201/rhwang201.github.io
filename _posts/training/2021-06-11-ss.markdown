Snatch  : 100x3x5

Pullup  : 50x5x3

Squat :   215x5x3

Dip     :  55x6x3

Box Jump   :   107cmx3x5

### Notes

Snatch alright, missed one rep technically. Overhead position still not that strong, will probably need to build up strength with OHS. Nice time warming up though. Could repeat or progress, overall progress will probably slow while building OHS

Pullups have a sticky point pretty early in the movement, but fine

1s pause for squats, kind of hard.

35lb plate for box jumps. Got feet up, but using hands. repeat

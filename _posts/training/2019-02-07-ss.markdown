Squat       :   230x5x3

Press       :   140x2,2,1

Power Clean :   165x3x5

Dip         :   120x2,1;45x10


### Notes

Pretty good day. Squats better, really focused on "chest up". Might've led to a more
knees-forward position, was pretty balanced overall. Trying to fix this weird thing with
right palm.

Press alright.

Power cleans pretty good. Getting on heel well during some reps.

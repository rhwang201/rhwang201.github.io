Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   215x2x5

Deadlift    :   335x5

Chinup      :   85x1x5

### Notes

Symptoms immediately popped up upon workout, so was a bit of a struggle. Good day to
check form though. Squats went okay, sat back more, leaned over more, kept neck neutral,
pushed the bar through rear delts.

Bench was pretty good, got good liftoffs from Kent.

Deads ok, be careful actually...

Chins easy, strong throughout entire ROM.

Snatch :   95x5x5

Overhead squat   :   125x3x3

Dip      :   80x5,4,3;55x5

Box jump  : 107x3x3

Curl    : 17.5x12x3

### Notes

Snatches pretty good! These were just snatches, no technique work today. I like the pause in the knee for warmups. Can progress, make sure to be aggressive with overhead position

OHS not bad, though lost one attempt at last set. Jerk the bar overhead, big breath and grip tight.

Dips hard, reset

Two pads for jumps

### Notes

Not a bad day, good sleep last night. Squats alright, taking a big breath and tucking the
pelvis. Make sure to stay in the slot during the entire ascent however; you are shifting
forward during the middle portion.

Press was a little hard, but got it. Feel free to take a wider foot stance.

Power cleans alright, got out of breath really easily. Chest up to remove slack in arms.
Get onto heels by jumping position to have a good bar path.

Clean pull  : 245x3x3

Bench     :  165x6x3

Box Jump   :   105cmx3x5

Overhead squat  : 100x3x3

Chinup    : 80x2x3


### Notes

Clean pulls fine, haven't done them in a while, kinda for fun

Box jump better! Not landing solidly on all of them, but no hands anymore. Could repeat or increase

OHS good, got all reps, could be a bit tighter on some

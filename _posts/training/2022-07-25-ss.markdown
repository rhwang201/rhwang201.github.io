### Notes

A bit of a mess because of the breakup, form/focus not there.

Squats hard, left knee and back feel iffy. Be careful here. Also good morning'ing

Power cleans pretty good actually, felt like less starfishing, though you were also facing away from the mirror so couldn't really see

Chins really hard today

Curls and face pulls easy

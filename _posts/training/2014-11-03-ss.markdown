Squat       :   165x5x3

Bench       :   180x5x3

Power Clean :   150x3x5

### Notes

Squat was okay, still going too low. Was a bit more tight at the bottom. Note,
core was very tired today, also high general fatigue.

Bench was way more fucking hard than it should've been. May begin 2.5lb
jumps...

Power cleans were okay. Easy strength-wise, but arms still aren't straight.
I think my starting position is starting to look better.

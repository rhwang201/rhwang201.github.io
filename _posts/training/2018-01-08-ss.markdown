### Notes

Really bad recovery this past weekend, drinking and sleep. Squats were not very good
(good job keeping it light). Brace the abs more, stay back.

Press okay, definitely not keeping abs tight through the entire movement.

Practicing power cleans. Once you hit jumping position, just jump (no bouncing movement).

Dips were good! Kept it tight.

Chins pretty easy good.

I think having another male nearby raises testosterone when lifting lol.

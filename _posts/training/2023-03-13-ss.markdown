Squat : 195x5x3

Dumbbell press  : 45x10x3

Pullup  : 65x5x3

Cable crossover : 43x13x3

Curls : 20x12,12,9

### Notes

Squats pretty good, can do another 10lb increase

Dumbbell press hard at first but not bad, progress

Repeat pullups, short ROM on last reps

Maybe add like a dropoff to crossovers, pretty hard

Snatch :   105x3x3

Overhead squat   :   130x3x3

Pullup      :   55x5x3

Box jump    : 107cmx3x5

### Notes

Good day. Think I failed one snatch. Not going all the way in the hole because of low stability. Pulls and height seem good though. Repeat

OHS good, tough. Repeat

Pullups good

Box jumps good, almost perfect (first set didn't land fully). Progress to three pads?

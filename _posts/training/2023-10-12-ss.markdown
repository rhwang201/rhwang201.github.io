Power clean  :  185x3x3

Dip  :  95x5x3

Chinup  :  25x10,9,7

Pallof press  : 40x15x3

Facepull  : 65x16x3

### Notes

Cleans a lot better. Knuckles down, wedge yourself under the bar. Long arms, drive up. Star fishing a bit, but receive overall a lot more smooth. 190x2x3 next?

Dips hard but got it. Progress, but don't expect to get it

Maybe switch it up to strength for chins

Tried to have stricter form for pallof presses. 1s hold on each rep

40x15x3 on step downs, with 30x3 tib raises (good burn)

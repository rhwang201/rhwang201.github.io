Pistol  :   0x6x3

Turkish Get Up   :   40x3x3

Box Jump   :   115cmx3x3

Power jerk  : 115x3x3

Pullup    : 35x5x3

### Notes

Should probably warm up with bodyweight squats before pistols. First set was shakey but not bad overall. Get up to sets of 7 before adding weight. TGU fine

Box jump pretty good actually. Still missing some, but a lot better than last time (maybe hitting a bit over 50%)

Played around with power jerks, 115 was easy

Power snatch :   95x3x3

Bench   :   155x3x3

Squat   :   190x5x3

Dip     :   50x5x3

### Notes

Still kind of weak/not feeling fully recovered overall. Snatch is meh, pretty inconsistent, still receiving the bar in a weak/soft position. Maybe throw in a form practice?

Bench fine, not easy, not hard.

Squats okay, be sure to not let loose/exhale in the hole. Can progress slowly.

Dips easy (you twig)

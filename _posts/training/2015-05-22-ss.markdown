Squat       :   225x5x3

Bench       :   225x2

Deadlift    :   385x5;295x7

Chinup      :   90x2;25x8

### Notes

Only 6 hours of sleep. Squat was improved though! Knees out and sitting down helped
balance over midfoot in the hole. Also kept back/lats pretty tight.

Bench warmups had good form. Actual set was pretty slow, also bicep a bit stressed, from
rack probably, but not a huge deal (yet).

Chest up on dead was nice. However, I don't think back was tight enough on working set.
Also, was very slow. Probably 5lb jumps now.

Max chins stress tendons/ligaments a lot. Maybe don't do too often.

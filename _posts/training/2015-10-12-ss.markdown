Squat       :   235x5x3

Deadlift    :   315x5

Facepull    :   25x15x3

### Notes

Pretty good workout! Fire ebbed and flowed, but it was there. Squats were okay, rack not
bad. Could stand up a bit taller. Pelvis was pretty tight. Keep lats tighter, try to be
a bit more even.

Press sucked. Top of movement really strong, just over my head not really. Probably need
to reset.

Deadlift was really good. Hips were a bit higher, back got pretty damn tight. Lats too.

Quick facepulls, and hip external rotators

### Notes

Okay day. Finally got a good amount of sleep (although digestive system was a little
active). Squats okay, mild shin splints from offsite yesterday interfered a bit. Keeping
ass back, staying tight, chest up, relaxed shoulders.

Press okay, fatigued from the weak.

Some good clean reps. Take out slack from arms during set-up, think of them as strings.
Pull bar into legs. Don't be afraid to go hard and fast!

Dips strong! Oddly, I was cutting off circulation in my palm.

Curls also strong.

Hip external rotator, overhead, couch mobility.

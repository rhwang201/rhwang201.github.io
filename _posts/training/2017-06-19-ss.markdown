Squat       :   195x5x3

Press       :   125x5x3

Dip         :   70x3x5

Curl        :   20x10x3

Circuit (roughly):
  Pushup    :   0x10x4
  Pullup    :   0x6x4
  Deadlift  :   135x6x4

### Notes

The cut is really hurting performance (also, seems like I'm still a little sick). Squat
warmup set with empty bar felt great, but form on working set wasn't great. Need to put
tension on posterior chain.

Press was hard, but grinded. Keep midsection tight.

Dips were really hard, did low volume.

Did a circuit that was pretty tiring. Should be good to keep on doing an ending circuit
for the cut.

Curls were chill.

### Notes

Doing all rack exercises together now for time efficiency.

Pauses for squats. Hurt knee and elbow from slipping in the morning. Pauses fine

Deads good, still getting better about not shrugging. Think of arms as strings

Bench fine, fixing wrist setup, but don't overdo it (bar falling off)

Lat pulldowns easy

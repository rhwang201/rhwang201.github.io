Chinup      :   25x7,7,5,2

### Notes

Wanted to lift today to deal with emotional stress. It actually went quite well despite
lifting hard the day before. In fact, this might be the hardest I've lifted in a while.
Squats were good, going in and out of hole well. Rack was a bit odd though; sometimes
was over-pulling my hand muscles somehow? Had a couple quality yells in there.

Triceps super tired on press. Trunk a little wobbly too.

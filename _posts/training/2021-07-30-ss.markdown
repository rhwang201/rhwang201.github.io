Power snatch :   85x3x3

Overhead squat   :   120x3x3

Dip      :   75x5x3;25x7x3

Box jump  : 105cmx3x3


### Notes

Technique for snatch, pulls, pauses. It's okay, need to figure out a plan here. Get straps?

OHS okay. Wrists fatigued. Also, stay more upright on ascent? One more time

Dips fine, though left shoulder a bit suspect on warmups. Good bounce out of the hole. Can progress.

Supersetted light dips w/ box jumps. jumps good, go for 5 sets

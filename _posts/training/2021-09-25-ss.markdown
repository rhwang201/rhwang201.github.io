Power clean :   185x3x3

Press   :   115x5x3

Squat   :   205x5x3

Chinup  :   55x5x3

### Notes

Cleans okay, but might be contacting low on the legs (scraping feeling). Also, motion doesn't look very fluid around the knees, a bit jerk-y. Good height for the most part. Overall, not much stamina for the workout, last sets/reps hard

Press fine, progress

Squats fine, doing toes more out, progress

Chins fine

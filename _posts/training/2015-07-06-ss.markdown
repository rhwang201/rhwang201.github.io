Squat       :   230x5x3

Press       :   130x5x5

Chinup      :   42.5x5x5

### Notes

Crappy recovery this weekend, but workout not too bad. Last squat set was good, was very
focused. However, rack is shitty; right elbow irritated.

Press was okay, think I'm holding my forearms more vertical now.

Chins were good, fast is good.

Deadlift  : 295x5x3

Bench : 165x5,4,4

Chinup  : 50x5x3

Cable crossover : 37x10x3

Incline hammer curl : 25x12,12,9

Lateral dumbbell raise  : 17.5x15x3

### Notes

Deads pretty hard, but this weight was good. Good job setting back, traps down.

Bench was too heavy. Bar path feels unfamiliar, not hitting consistent spot on chest

Chins super easy

Crossovers felt good, getting good ROM

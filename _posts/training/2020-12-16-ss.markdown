Power snatch :   100x3x3

Bench   :   160x3x3

OHS     :   95x3

Dip     :   55x5x3

### Notes

Snatches okay, not great, still not receiving in a good position, taking a step forward usually. Would repeat weight

Bench pretty easy, trying to go a little faster

OHS pretty bad. Skipped squats today because of right knee pain

Dips easy

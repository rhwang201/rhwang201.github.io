### Notes

Hung over, and first day back from being sick. Not bad all things considered. Cleans felt pretty powerful. Tried a bit slower and more controlled off the floor. Make sure bar is close to the body. Can progress

Somehow got press? Form not great (I think?), some weird leaning back after the head, feel it in the lats. Oh well, not that bad, progress.

Squats on the other hand not great. Chest and hips not rising at the same pace. Latter sets better actually, keeping midfoot and locking knees after a while

Power clean  :  185x2x3

Dip  :  90x5x3

Pullup  :  25x9,9,7

Pallof press  : 50x17x3

Facepull  : 65x14x3

### Notes

Cleans okay. Knee a bit rough on receive. Low contact. Repeat

Dips hard on warmup, eeked out last reps. Repeat or progress?

Did some bodyweight tibs, and the slanted squat thing (knees over toes)

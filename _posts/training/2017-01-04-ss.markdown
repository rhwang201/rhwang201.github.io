Squat       :   195x7x3

Bench       :   175x5x3

Deadlift    :   315x5x3

Chinup      :   0x7x5

### Notes

Rack is better, but not good. Squat itself not bad. Staying over midfoot, sitting into
squat (pelvis down). Need to consistently keep back tight.

Bench whatever, elbows and right shoulder aggravated.

Deads easy.

### Notes

Squats weren't good. Too fatigued for proper form? Not sitting into hole on tight
muscles, but just like anatomy, if that makes sense?

Press was weak as well, brace abs more.

Power cleans alright actually. Avoid banging your shins though. Getting a feel for the
bar path, thinking less about arms.

Make sure applying pressure to inside of hand for dips.

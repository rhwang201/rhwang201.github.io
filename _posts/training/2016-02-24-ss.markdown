Back Extension      :   45x15x4

Facepull    :   45x15x4

### Notes

Okay day. Not great recovery, still feeling fatigued. Took squats super careful, because
Monday sucked. Rack is better on warmups, need to trap bar between back and wrists. Find
the groove more easily now. Taking time on empty bar sets helps a lot to get into the
groove. Practiced staying tight going into the hole. Still need to stay over midfoot on
ascent though.

Press easy. Press fingerprints into the bar.

Back extensions good, tiring.

Facepulls are hard.

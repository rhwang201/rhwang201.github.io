Power clean :   190x3x3

Press   :   115x5x3

Squat   :   220x5x3

Chinup  :   55x5x3

### Notes

Cleans alright, definitely catching a few low. Repeat

Press good, squeezing the bar and keeping the chest up. Progress

Squats better, going ATG and staying more upright. Last rep was tough, can probably progress carefully.

Chins fine

Breath work while doing ankle mobility made such a big difference

Power snatch :   85x3x3

Bench   :   160x5x3

Front squat   :   135x5x3

Dip  :   50x5x3

### Notes

Snatch not bad. Bar definitely swinging away from the body, keep it close for the second pull. Also, stay a bit more over the bar.

Bench alright, make sure bar path is low enough

Front squats alright, take a big breath for the trunk

Trying to bounce a bit more for dips

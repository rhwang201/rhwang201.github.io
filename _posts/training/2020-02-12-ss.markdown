Squat       :   210x5x3

Press       :   110x6x63

Power clean :   160x3x5

Dip         :   35x6x3

Curl        :   20x9x3

### Notes

Squat warmup form is really good, standing up tall out of rack, chin down, head back,
leaning over; but working set too heavy, bring it down.

Tired for press but got it. Tight core, double chin

Power cleans mostly good! Last rep of last two sets had horrible racks though.

### Notes

Squats alright. Focused on a "concave" position, more upright, abs tighter.

Press pretty easy, also focused on tight abs.

It's time to invest in formal training for the clean. Recorded one set, and you're still
shrugging the bar to get into jumping position. Did top-down practice, trying to slide
the bar into jumping position. Also, kept shoulders back in the jumping position.

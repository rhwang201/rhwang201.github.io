### Notes

Did technique practice for snatch which helped, in particular the second pull, and
avoiding arm rowing. Got the bar into position by opening up hips with chest, bar
position and path looked decent.

Cleans getting harder, but not bad still.

Still tired for push press, definitely didn't push very hard starting here.

Squats felt heavier than they should've, considering it was a light day. During warmups,
focused on upper back, abs, and tripod.

OHS okay, a little soft.

Some partial chins

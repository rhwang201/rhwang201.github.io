Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   215x3x3

Deadlift    :   405x4

Chinup      :   82.5x2x3

### Notes

Squats were okay. Wider stance helps, still not totally stable in the hole though. Rack
slighlty better, make sure to chest up hard.

Bench was pretty good, focus on keeping it even. Arm/shoulder a bit bothered from squat
rack.

Failed 405 for the first time ever. Was too tired.

Chins were good!

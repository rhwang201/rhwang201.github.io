Squat   :   195x5x5

Press   :   105x5x5

Dip     :   35x10x3

Facepull    :   70x15x5

Curl    :   15x14,14,10

### Notes

Squat was pretty good. Faced away from mirror. Stood up tall, set pelvis/back. This
helped most of the first reps be super solid. Probably can sit back more, and keep lats
tight, enabling more back angle.

Press was super easy.

Dips good.

Facepull easy, increase weight next time.

Curls good.

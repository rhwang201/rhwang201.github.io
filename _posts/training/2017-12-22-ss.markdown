Squat       :   210x5x3

Bench       :   225x2x3

Deadlift    :   325x5

Chinup      :   100x2,2,1

Lateral Raise   :   25x7x3

### Notes

Squats not bad. Bar "back", chest up during set up, set pelvis, big breath and tight
torso, stay "back" during ascent.

Bench pretty good. Squeeze the bar, and drive through the heels. Big breath.

Deads not bad. Make sure scapula and shoulders are "down".

Squat       :   135x5x3

Bench       :   200x5x3

Deadlift    :   275x5x3

Chinup      :   35x5x5

### Notes

Definitely not eating/sleeping enough. Squats were...not existant. Lower back pain, left
anterior hip pain. Prob need to lay low a couple workouts.

Bench was really easy on first two sets. Had a liftoff. Good placement, staying tight,
strong throughout movement.

Deads okay.

Chins good.

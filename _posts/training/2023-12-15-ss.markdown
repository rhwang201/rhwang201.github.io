Bulgarian split squat  :  30kgx10x3

Dip  :  42.5kgx4; 41.25kgx5,4

Chinup  :  11.25kgx10,10,8

Pallof press  : 65x20x3

Facepull  : 110x14x3

Jump squat  :  50kgx5x3

Skullcrusher  :  15kgx10x3

### Notes

Split squats easy

Probably could've got dips, but setup is jank (not stable bars, weights hitting the structure)

Weight on pallof press and facepull were off, probably a bit lighter than usual

Supersetted jump squats and skullcrushers, was fun

Squat       :   205x5x3 

Bench       :   200x5x5;175x7

Deadlift    :   Fail

Chinup      :   35x5x5

### Notes

Almost a really good day. Squats were actually good. Shoulders were back and more relaxed
for rack. Thought about hips during reps and was able to keep trunk rigid on ascents.
Also felt descent depth.

Bench was alright, playing around with leg stance. No spotter, so could've been better.
Did dropoff for more volume, which I haven't done in a while

Deadlifts were bad. They felt hard from the beginning, then superior glutes kind of
seized on last warm up...

Chins were good. Used more bounce than usual. Fought for last reps

Power clean : 160x3x3

Bench : 135x10x3

Bulgarian split squat : 60x10x3

Cable row : 70x8x3

Tricep extension  : 30x12x2

Pallof press  : 25x10x3

### Notes

Cleans fine, first set meh, got better over time. Think there was less rowing at the end, since bar was contacting lower. Progress.

Good pump on bench. Also good form, felt super tight and in control. Pretty consistent bar path

BSS good, hard. Actually all accessory hard. Can probably start using Friday's as ski accessory days

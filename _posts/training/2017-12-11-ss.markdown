### Notes

Spend the past weekend skiing in Canada. Evening workout. Right ankle still fucked up
from squats...Sit back a little more, and maintain back angle.

Press was pretty good, squeeze the bar harder.

Cleans better. Think about hitting it towards your chest, that cue led to more of
a triple extension.

Dips not great, maybe fatigued.

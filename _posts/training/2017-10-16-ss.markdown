### Notes

Been sleep deprived, finally got a good nights sleep last night. Squats were okay, rack
is a bit messed up (weight on arms). Decent job sitting down into hole.

Press pretty good. Chalk and a tight grip helps.

Power cleans...getting better? Hit high, chest up, shoulders down and back at start
position. Get under the bar fast.

Lost focus a bit on dips...cute girl lol. Stay centered in the hole though.

Curls strong, woo...

Squat:          155x5x3

Press:          120x5x3

Deadlift:       245x5

Chinup:         25x7,7,5

### Notes

Only about 4hrs of sleep last night.

Back squats are okay, still going too low. Rack is better. Sitting back is
pretty good as well.

Press was a little hard at the end. Might need 2.5lb jumps now. Form was mostly
good, but lockout/above the head was usually a little shakey.

Deads were okay. One thing I noticed is that sometimes after I set up, right
when the bar leaves the floor, my lower back relaxes a bit.

Chinups were meh, repeat same weight next time.

### Notes

Power cleans were meh, over the place. Also, think you strained your lower back, careful here

Bench good, feel a lot of tri's actually

Pallof good

BSS good, used the different bench thing. Probably start with your weaker (right) leg first

ROM on press limited at top

Ski stuff at end, banded lateral, X walk thing, lateral single leg jumps

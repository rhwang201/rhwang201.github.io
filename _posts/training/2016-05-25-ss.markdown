### Notes

Light day yay. Supersetted presses and pause squats. Presses were whatever, but uneven?
Apparently right side was lagging. Did a pause for the last rep of each set. Did pause
squats at 105 and 135. Not bad. Left hip is better-ish, need to stay balanced over
midfoot, set the trunk, and stick the ass back.

Back extensions pretty good actually! Maybe make sure feet are planted against the thing,
so you're not stressing your hamstrings.

Facepulls good too.

Shrugs harder than expected.

Front Squat :   175x5x3

Bench       :   155x5x3

Power Clean :   135x3x5

### Notes

Holy shit.

Front squats were good and bad. Some reps, I kept my back very vertical and
balanced well over midfoot. Other reps, I was very loosey-goose. Right knee
hurt a bit after...

Bench was easy.

Power cleans were meh. Take more time to setup, and think about keeping arms
straight.

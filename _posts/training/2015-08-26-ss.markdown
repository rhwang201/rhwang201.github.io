Dip         :   0x17x3

### Notes

A little hungry, a little tired this morning. Squats felt heavy, also used a different
bar, so rack didn't feel right. Need to keep weight over midfoot and back tight.

Press was good. Especially top portion of lockout, that was _strong_, and snappy. Descent
still a little bonkers because of back though.

Did some light deads today, felt good. Abs haven't been worked like that in a while. Big
breath, squeeze chest up.

Dips also flew, was a little loose on them. Learn to hit depth, and look forward, not in
the mirror.

### Notes

Pretty good day. Squat form is getting better? Knees are more forward now, ie, easier to
get into hole.

Bench was pretty good actually. Only, didn't have a spotter, so couldn't push.

Deads pretty good.

Chins were hard.

Supersetted lateral raises and knee tucks.

Not very intense biking.

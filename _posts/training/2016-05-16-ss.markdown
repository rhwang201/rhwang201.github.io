Press       :   130x5x4,4x1;135x1

Deadlift    :   275x5x3

Chinup      :   35x5x3,4,3

### Notes

Ehh day. Woke up in the middle of sleep cycle, so was super drowsy. Press was hard, but
actually not bad. A little uneven, but worked hard to keep abs tight. Working in with
tufmud3r threw me off. Shoulda, coulda gotten last rep.

Deads sucked. Used thicker bar, had to alternate eventually. Back might be a little
tweaked.

Tired for chins.

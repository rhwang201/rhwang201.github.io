### Notes

Front squat pretty hard. Tried back squat cues, but maybe don't do that.

Rows fine, a bit cheating per usual

Deads good. Lower back tender going into today though.

Press fine. Bottom ROM is where discomfort is. Keep it in the endurance zone.

Shoulder actually felt fine for cable crossover

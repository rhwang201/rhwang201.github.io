Squat       :   215x5x3

Bench       :   190x5x5

Deadlift    :   275x5x3

Dip         :   50x5x5

### Notes

Mixed day. Shitty recovery this weekend from camping, I should really get comfortable
shoveling food after I get home. Less rack problems, but difficulty maintaining position
in hole. Lower pack pain. Should lighten and re-focus.

Bench was slow as hell, but got it, and kept decent symmetry (through much effort).

Alternated deads with hard volleyball spikes. Deads not bad, mostly balanced over
midfoot, got lats, back and traps tight before each rep.

Dips are easy? Remember to lean forward on first reps.

Squat       :   185x5x3

Press       :   110x3x3

Power Clean :   105x3x5;115x3

Dip         :   30x5x3

Curl        :   22.5x9x3

### Notes

Squats okay, working on chest up, elbows down, knees stable in the hole.

Press good, chest up.

Power cleans...meh. If you start the movement top down, it's alright. But starting from
the bottom is no bueno. Might need to re-learn setup for cleans?

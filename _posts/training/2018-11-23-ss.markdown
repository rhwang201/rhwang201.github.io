Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   180x7x3

Deadlift    :   300x5

Pullup      :   80x3x3;35x7

Back Extension  :   25x10x3

### Notes

Good day. Squats easy. Extended upper back to set rack. Tucked pelvis _and_ kept back
tight on descent, so knees didn't move.

Bench easy, five or six with one breath.

Deads good! Neck back helped a lot.

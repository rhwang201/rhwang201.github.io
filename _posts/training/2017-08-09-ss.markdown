### Notes

Nice, easy day. Squats were pretty good, keeping back angle constant during ascent.

Press good, focused on squeezing abs into spine. Did a bit of shoulder mobility (trap
under the bar, and supine shoulder-into-socket).

Dips good, focused on maintaining stretch at bottom.

Ab wheel getting stronger.

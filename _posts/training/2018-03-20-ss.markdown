### Notes

Pretty good day. Switched schedule because of dance performances. Squat pretty good.
Wasn't able to "grip" the floor as well today, but managed. Can start off a bit
"forward", then keep weight back as knees stop moving forward.

Press really good. Fingerprints in the bar, big breath, tight core.

Power cleans a lot better! Feel like I'm hitting the jumping position a lot better now.
Cueing the fingers to help pull the bar back into the legs. Also chest up and engaged
lats. Almost visualizing the bar resting on my legs for jumping position.

Dips okay, not great.

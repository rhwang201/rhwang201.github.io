Power clean :   190x2x5

Press   :   127.5x5,4,3,2

Squat   :   225x5x3

Chinup  :   70x5,5,4

Bulgarian split squat : 45x10x3

### Notes

Power cleans inconsistent. Once your form is good, they look good. Tried to keep shoulders over bars. Avoid jumping forward.

Press not bad, seems like not enough ab strength.

Squats good, thinking about knees over second toe. Relatively upright and easy today, can progress

Forget exact reps for chins, but something like that.

Threw in BSS, was pretty challenging on right leg

Some tricep hypertrophy too

Power snatch :   95x3x3

Push Press    :   115x3x3

Squat   :   185x6x3

Dip     :   45x5x3

### Notes

Snatch alright, receiving position soft for last sets. Could redo or small increase

Bench was taken, so played around with push press. Racked the bar on shoulders, had a full hand grip. Definitely felt weird.

Squats alright, got a bit of tempo going, though legs still tired

Dips easy.

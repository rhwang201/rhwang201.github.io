Squat       :   210x5x3

Bench       :   210x3

Back Extension  :   25x12x5

### Notes

Felt good this morning. Squat's were okay, focusing on pelvis. Could be a bit more stable
in and out of hole. Really make sure to set everything properly with the big breath.

Failed fourth bench rep off the chest.

Lower back really fatigued.

Hips, single leg glute bridges 5x3. Also practiced volleyball spikes.

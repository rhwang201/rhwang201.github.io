### Notes

Feliz Cinco de Mayo! Numbers don't look that bad, but I don't feel great about today.
Squat didn't feel as good, definitely still not staying completely tight in the hole.

Bench was okay, wish I had a spotter so I could push myself more.

Deads were okay, lower back can probably be set better at bottom.

Chins were aight.

### Notes

Happy birthday to my Mom! Not a bad day surprisingly. Glad I dropped weight on squats.
Standing up tall is a good cue, focused on pelvis and was able to stay tight on reps.
Maybe continue keeping weight low, volume up?

Finally got press. Form degenerated a bit in end, but good effort.

Damn that tricep pump on dips. Good depth though. Make sure to finish the rep at the top.

Supersetted back extensions and curls. Cool brah.

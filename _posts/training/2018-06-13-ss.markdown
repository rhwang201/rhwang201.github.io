### Notes

Decent day. Kept squats light because I didn't feel ready for 225. They were okay. Chest
up and out, shoulders down, look forward, neck back.

Press good, kind of experimented with a grip that lets the bar sit more directly over
forearm.

Power cleans were hard. In general, okay. Treat them more seriously. Don't start second
pull until you pass the knee.

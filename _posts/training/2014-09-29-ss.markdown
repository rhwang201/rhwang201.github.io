Front Squat:    155x5x3

Press:          127.5x5x3

Deadlifts:      245x5

Chinups:        23x6,6,5

### Notes

Front squats were pretty good, taking a big breath and staying tight helps.
Press was pretty good too actually, try to stay more balanced, and get under
the bar quicker. Deadlifts were meh, practice form on warmup reps more. Chinups
were strong, but nearing limit.

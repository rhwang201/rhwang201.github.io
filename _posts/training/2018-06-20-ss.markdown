### Notes

Good day! Switched up reps, was able to focus on form while still getting work done. For
squats, good job on chest up. Really rotate that upper ribcage up and have the shoulders
down. That helped stay tight and in the slot.

Bench was good. Good job squeezing the bar actually. Set the bar position in palm, then
squeeze hard to keep it there. Crazy difference.

Deads good. Make sure to elongate the neck and keep weight on traps.

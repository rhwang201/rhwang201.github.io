Power clean  :  175x3x3

Dumbbell press  :  40x13x3

Pullup  :  25x8x3

Facepull  : 65x18x3

Tricep extension  :  40x11x3

Hammer curl  :  15x14,14,12

### Notes

Cleans a lot better. Tight back, stay balanced over the whole foot. Could micro-load maybe.

Press good, could repeat and focus on eccentric, or progress.

Pullups strong, progress

Facepull challenging.

Repeat triceps

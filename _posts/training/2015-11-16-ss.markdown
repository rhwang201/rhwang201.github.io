### Notes

Horrible recovery this weekend, and fatigue/working capacity showed it. However, not
a bad workout! Squats were okay, pushed bar into traps on ascents.

Bench was pretty good! Was talking to Daniel (just met him) and Max a bit. Fourth set was
the best fourth set I've ever had. Really in the moment, didn't over think form,
adrenaline pumping, even grunted on fifth rep! Failed, but it was a good workout.

Was dead tired for deads. Hardest set of 375 I've ever done. Back was definitely a bit
rounded, so fatigued. Had to reset for last rep and that killed.

Rushed and tired neutral grip chins. Should reset 5lbs probably

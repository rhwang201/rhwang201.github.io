Squat       :   195x7x3

Bench       :   155x5x3

Back Extension      :   45x13x5

Facepull    :   45x13x5

### Notes

Rack regressed. Was using thicker bar. *FIX THAT*. More volume was a good idea though.
Squat itself isn't bad. Focused on the pelvis a lot, and seems to have been tighter as
a result. Also stayed over midfoot more.

Bench whatever (arms hurting).

Back extensions good.

Face pulls pretty good too. Taking a big breath helps.

Squat       :   185x5x3

Press       :   120x5x5

Deadlift    :   245x5x3

### Notes

Decent recovery this weekend, a little hungry in gym, but not at all debilitating. Squat
was okay, rack might be a bit too low.

Press was challenging, wrist still hurts a little. Last set was a bit too lax, in order
to get it up. Weak point in lower 2/3 of movement?

Deadlift good. Weight on traps now. Good setup.

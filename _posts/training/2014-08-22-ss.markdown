### Notes

Did some forms sets with squats. Getting better, think a lot about keeping the
weight over mid-foot.

Should've gotten press. Form was okay, remember big breath and abs in all the
way through.

Form sets weith deadlifts too. Also, think about midfoot, keeping the bar
against your legs, and putting your ass lower.

Chinups pretty strong, maybe can start doing weighted soon. (Although they
probably seem strong because there's less mass than usual in lower body...)

Squat       :   220x5x3

Bench       :   165x5x3

Back Extension  :   25x13x5

### Notes

Not bad today! Green tea still makes my stomach weird. Squats were decent, actually
focused on warmups, _which pays off_. Good bar positioning on back, though about sitting
the ass back and keeping the back rigid and tight.

Bench was okay, upper body not very strong. First two sets weren't great in large part
due to faulty grip, which I corrected in third set. Wrists should be straight.

Back extensions cool.

Hip, single leg glute bridge 8x5 (per leg).

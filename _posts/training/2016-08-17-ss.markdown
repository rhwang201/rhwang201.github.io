Squat       :   215x5x3

Bench       :   200x5x2,4x1

Deadlift    :   335x5

Chinup      :   45x5x2,4x1,1x1

GHR         :   0x3x3

### Notes

Squat okay, still not perfect tightness in posterior chain. Either do a light day, or go
up.

Bench wasn't bad, a bit uneven. Missed last rep.

Deads were good.

Chins were good.

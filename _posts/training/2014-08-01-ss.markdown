Bench:      155x5x3

Power Clean:   130x5x3

### Notes

Took a break from squats. Bench was pretty easy, make sure to be more
controlled on way down. Power cleans were pretty good too, hit higher, closer
to the chest, explode more. Did some squat reps with the bar, think I was going
too low before. Will squat again Monday. Also, try to do more mobility. Opened
up overhead position with band stretch.

Squat : 195x8x3

Press : 90x6x3

Pullup  : 15kgx8,8,6

Tricep extension  : 65x13,13,8

Incline curl  : 20x13x3

Dumbbell bench  : 35x10x3

### Notes

Tired day. Squats pretty good, no need to rush at this intensity

Press okay, better than before but still a little weak at sticking point

Fatigued for everything else, but good effort

Dumbbell bench easy

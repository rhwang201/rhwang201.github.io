### Notes

Still working on second pull for both Oly. Want to stay over the bar, ie don't initiate
too early. Currently not finding hip on snatch.

Snatch pull helped, good call.

Squats getting hard, probably need to slow down progression soon. Be careful on foot
weight.

OHS still good, ramp it up, cut down to three sets.

Squat       :   205x5x3

Bench       :   170x5x3

Deadlift    :   270x5

Chinup      :   25x7,7,6

Skullcrusher    :   40x11x3

### Notes

Pretty good day, squats getting heavy, but alright. First set is a bit forward, but
latter sets are okay.

Bench alright, need to grip tighter.

Deads good and easy.

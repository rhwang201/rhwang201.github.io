Squat       :   225x5x3

Press       :   135x4,3,3,2

Power Clean :   170x3x4

Dip         :   85x5,5,4,2


### Notes

Meh day. Squat form not as good. Top of knee getting tweaked, means knees are sliding
forward. Also, need to keep back angle constant, hips shooting up too quickly. Can think
"neck back".

Press was kinda weak. Transition above head was better though, using muscles more.

Cleans getting lower...

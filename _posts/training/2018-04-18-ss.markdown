### Notes

Good day. Squats a lot better. Shoulders down onto lats (thanks dance), tuck the pelvis
as you sit into hole, drive the hips up. Squat felt really easy today.

Press good, trying to get weight over the forearm.

Power cleans okay. Should probably also do tight, compacted lats here, to remove tension
from arms. Push through the heels, and get to the jumping position.

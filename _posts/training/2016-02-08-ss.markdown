### Notes

Not enough recovery this weekend, workout was okay. Felt good at times, but then became
sloppy. Squat wasn't bad actually. Focused on keeping back really tight and sticking the
ass back. Some reps felt really tight. Rack is pretty good, focused on putting bar on
back, squeezed before liftoff.

Bench was hard, then got better, then I lost focus a bit and started straining left
shoulder a bit. Was careful rather than reckless, so missed a rep.

Deadlifts cause I saw a guy with big traps and felt bad haha.

Dips were pretty good. Mixing it up from pullups.

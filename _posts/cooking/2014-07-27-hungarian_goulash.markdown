While in Budapest, I greatly enjoyed having _Beef Goulash_. The goulash I had
in Budapest was mostly meat and some thickened sauce/broth. I fell in love
instantly and vowed to make some back in the states.

My vague plan was to slow cook some beef with a bunch of paprika and some
onions. I researched the art of the goulash and found that many people put much
more than what I had in mind in their goulash. How dare they challenge my
goulash experience!

I went along with what most people said. Apparently, Hungarian farmers around
the 1600s and 1700s created goulash. They chucked in whatever parts of animal
they had laying around along with their local tubers into a kettle and boiled
it for a long time. This resembles more of a stew than what I had in Budapest,
but, hey, I like stews, too.

First, the ingredients:

Made chili and cornbread this past weekend as part of the slow,
momentum-gaining movement to start eating and lifting big again.

Followed a variant of this
[recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/slow-cooker-chili-ii/) for the chili.
Main substance was 93/7 ground beef (pretty cheap actually, if bulk) and pinto
beans. Might have been a bit too tomato-y, next time will try to spice it up
more. The Blue Moon also might not have been necessary.

This was my first time baking cornbread, and it was awesome! Baked it in the
castiron (which was really fun), per this
[recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alexandra-guarnaschelli/cast-iron-skillet-corn-bread-recipe.html).
I substituted milk+lemon juice for buttermilk, and it seems to have turned out
fine. I was a little shocked/surprised/scared/excited at the amount of butter
required. Cooked the batter for about a minute on the stove top, to ensure
crispy edges. It turned out really well. Perhaps a bit plain compared to the
gourment options I've been having, but I liked it a lot. I'll see how long it
stays moist for.

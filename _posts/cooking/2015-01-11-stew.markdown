Trying new things again! Beef stew, this time, a dish I really like. I followed
[two](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/old-time-beef-stew-recipe.html)
[recipes](http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2013/01/sunday-night-stew/).

The stew turned out awesome! Browning the meat before makes such a nice
difference, as well as including the meat juices in the stew. For vegetables,
I used carrots and celery; I'll try out turnips next time, per the second
recipe. There was a bit too much of _something_ in the finished stew, I would
guess it was either the tomato paste or Worcestershire. In any case, this is an
easy recipe that will easily become a go-to, with plenty of room to play
around. Only downside is it takes quite a while (2 hours).

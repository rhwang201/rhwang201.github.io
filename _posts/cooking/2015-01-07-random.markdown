Felt like cooking something different tonight for dinner (and I had no meat
defrosted), so I had scrambled eggs, pan fried potatoes, and stir fry
vegetables.

For the potatoes, I followed Gordon Ramsay's
[recipe](http://youtu.be/atj_WlIfzZg). I learned about parboiling. Overall,
I think the recipe can be really good. I fried in the cast iron, which was
okay. Also, as I predicted, the garlic burned pretty quickly. Next time, I'll
put the garlic in later and have more oil so the skin of the potatoes can get
more crispy.

I don't remember the last time I made a good stir fry, and I had broccoli and
carrots at home, so I gave it a try. Worked out pretty well actually. Constant
movement over high eat did the trick, although not as quickly as I had
initially expected. Adding soy sauce is awesome, by the way, but I put too much
this time.

Good to have more options for basic ingredients in my cooking.

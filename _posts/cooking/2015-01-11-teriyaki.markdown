Quick meal, wanted to try something new. Usually when I bake chicken thighs,
I just lazily throw some seasoning on. This time, I tried making
[teriyaki chicken](http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Baked-Teriyaki-Chicken/Detail.aspx).

The recipe is pretty easy. I eyeballed most of the ingredients. I think
I turned the heat too high when making the sauce, as it thickened too quick. It
was still really tasty though! Shouldn't be hard to get the consistency down
after one or two more takes.

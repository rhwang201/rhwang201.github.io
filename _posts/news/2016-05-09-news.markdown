I am trying something new out. I have been reading the news more recently, in particular
US politics. I will record daily news highlights on this blog. (A lot of this may mirror
Vox Sentences).

* Brazil's government is consumed by scandal and sillyness in the high government.
* Conservatives are claiming Facebook's Trending Topics is biased.

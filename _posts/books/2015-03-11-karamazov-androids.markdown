Finished two books recently.

_The Brothers Karamazov_ was my random piece of famous literature for the
season. This hefty novel tells the story of the Karamazov family and the murder
of the patriarch. The setting, nineteenth century Russia, is quite key to the
story; much of the cultural references were lost upon me. I enjoyed the story
for its exploration of human personalities in the four very different siblings.
However, Dostoevsky's questions about God and free will did not leave much of
an impression upon me, perhaps because I am strongly not religious. Although
I didn't appreciate it as a masterpiece in literature, I did enjoy reading this
novel.

I was spontaneously lent _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep_ by a coworker
one day. It is a nice contrast to _Karamazov_. A short, exciting sci-fi
dystopian, _Androids_ asks us what it means to be human, telling an engaging
story along the way. In contrast to _Karamazov_, I wouldn't call the characters
very intriguing. I enjoyed how Dick explored the relationship between
artificial intelligence and humans, in particular, how one can (or cannot)
distinguish between the two. _Androids_ is a short, fun read, but I wish it had
gone a bit deeper to explore the dystopia and questions about future
technology.

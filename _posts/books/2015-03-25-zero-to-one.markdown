![Zero to One]({{site.url}}/images/book/zero_to_one.jpg "Zero to One")

After _Into Thin Air_, I didn't have any books on my reading list. I downloaded
a bunch that sounded interesting, but nothing was enticing. I asked to borrow
my coworker's copy of _Zero to One_, by Peter Thiel, and breezed through it.

_Zero to One_ is a quick collection of tips about how to build a successful
startup, backed primarily by Thiel's personal anecdotes. As reviews on Amazon
attested to, a substantial portion of the book I found to be contrived
storytelling/analogies. There were some good takeaways, however:

* The concept of globalization vs technology
* Monopolies are good
* War is costly
* Valuation is sum of all profits in future (growth _and_ durability)
* Proprietary technology, network effect, economies of scale, branding
* You are not a lottery ticket
* Power law
* Secrets exist
* CLV > CAV, sales matters

I enjoyed reading _Zero to One_, because it helped to kindle a bit of ambition
in me once again, if only, perhaps, because it explores so many influential and
successful companies that have actually managed to build things of worth to
humanity's future. While the number of substantial takeaways isn't high, the
book is short and pleasant enought that I didn't mind.

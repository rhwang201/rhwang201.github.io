I randomly picked up _A Lesson Before Dying_, by Ernest J. Gaines
(\*chuckle\*), at the
[Fort Mason book sale](http://www.friendssfpl.org/?Big_Book_Sale), which is
totally awesome by the way. I wasn't expecting too much from the novel, but it
was surprisingly pleasant.

First off, the novel is extremely simplistic, both in prose and plot. It
appears to be a book commonly assigned to younger students. Indeed, having read
the back-cover-summary first, there were many points in the novel I grew bored
with the slow, simplistic story development. What I did appreciate is the look
we get into life for the African American in the Post-Antebellum South. The
main character has an interesting dilemna, being an educated man who
nonetheless is always cognizant of his ethnic past, whether though interactions
with whites or blacks. Gaines also succeeds in twanging some of those heart
chords with the bareness of the human condition when faced with injustice and
death.

Overall, an easy read that I appreciated for the culture it exposed and the
human strength in all of us it highlighted.

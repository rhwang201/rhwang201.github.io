This movie pleasantly surprised me. The synopsis of the movie sounded quirky and odd. The
movie itself was so human, as well as forward-looking. Watching Samantha and Theo's
relationship develop evoked compassion and hope. It reminded me of my "real"
relationships. I enjoyed how the end of the movie shifted towards the differences that
would exist between AIs and humans. Despite the departure of the AIs and Samantha, the
ending left me with hope for Theo.

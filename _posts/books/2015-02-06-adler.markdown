Decided to check out priceonomics.com tonight, following some suggestions from
a colleague who recently gave a talk about financial statements. I enjoyed
reading
[The Invention of the Aeropress](http://priceonomics.com/the-invention-of-the-aeropress/).
It is an easy, fun, well-written article about the story of Alan Adler,
a Stanford professor and inventor, known for creating the Aerobie and the
Aeropress.

Here is a passage that struck me.

> “I was never happier than when I was learning a new discipline,” he tells us.
> 
> This curiosity led to his pursuit of a diverse range of hobbies; as “the type
> of person who always seeks ways to make things better,” his hobbies invariably
> led to inventions. Today, he owns over 40 patents -- some of which are in
> surprising fields.

In particular, this quote reminds me of Feynman. It seems these characters are
always able to enter new fields without a fuss. This perhaps illustrates the
importance of fundamental critical thinking skills.


One of his inventing tips also stood out to me.

> Be willing to try things even if you aren't too confident they’ll work.
> Sometimes you’ll get lucky.

This willingness to try things, to be curious and explore, seems to really pay
off.

Smarts plus curiosity and ingenuity; that's what Adler has. That's awesome.

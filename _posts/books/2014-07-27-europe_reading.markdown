Got to read a decent bit in Europe on trains, planes, whatnot. Here's a quick
list with key points/thoughts:

* _What Every BODY is Saying_, Joe Navarro

  This book was pretty cool. Not as
  "here is a list of body cues that ALWAYS indicate the person is X" as
  I thought it would be. Navarro begins by noting a person's basic responses to
  threats: fight, flight or freeze. He also give motivation for body cues
  through evolutionary reasoning. Then, he proceeds across the body, noting
  common movement patterns, always being careful to note that while these
  gestures in general signify certain emotions, analysis must always be placed
  in a context, to be more complete.

  One main take-away was look at the feet/legs, specifically where they point,
  how they are spread. Also, look for ventral/dorsal fronting, as well as
  leaning. Body cues are powerful tools in noting people's underlying emotions,
  but it'll take continuous practice for accuracy and depth of prediction to
  increase.

* _Influence, The Psychology of Persuasion_, Robert Cialdini

  Reciprocation, Commitment and Consistency, Social Proof, Liking, Authority,
  Scarcity. These are the mechanism by which the "click-whirs" that Cialdini
  mention work. I haven't applied learnings from this book too much yet;
  I should keep them in mind whenever I see advertising or suspect others of
  attempting to influence others.

* _The Right Stuff_, Tom Wolffe

  A fun, but tiring read. Wolffe has a very unique style, which while
  entertaining to read, can leave one tired after a chapter. _The Right Stuff_
  is concerned mainly with the inner details of the "sky boys" (a term I just
  made up), and how the flying pyramid changed with the space program. Wolffe
  paints the flight fraternity as a very unique group of guys, in love with
  flying planes and themselves to the limit, driving fast cars, drinking lots,
  and climbing to that unspoken-of but universally acknowledged top of the
  brotherhood pyramid. Pilots were modern day single combat pilots, heros of
  the skys. That title was stripped however from normal pilots when the space
  program was launched. Originally scoffed at as lab rats, astronauts suddenly
  found themselves at the top of the pyramid. The rest is history. _The Right
  Stuff_ is not at all a technical account into the Mercury missions; rather it
  explores the wild characters, the pilots, who created a new order of pilots
  and made their ways into the history books.

* _Snow Crash_, Neal Stephenson
* _Quiet_, Susan Cain
* _2001: A Space Odyssey_, Arthur Clarke
* _The Fault in Our Stars_, John Green
* _Millionaire Next Door_, Thomas J. Stanley

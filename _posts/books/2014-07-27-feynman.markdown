![Richard Feynman]({{site.url}}/assets/feynman.gif "Richard Feynman")

Richard Feynman sure was an interesting character. Having just finished two of
his books, _Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman_ and _What Do You Care What Other
People Think_, I can say that Feynman is definitely role model status for me,
up there with Theodore Roosevelt and Elon Musk. Here are some lessons I learned
from him.

* __The world is amazing.__ If you accept that statement as a fact, you will
  forever be curious. In order to function at all, we must dumb our perception
  down and only operate on a human-scale level of things. But just consider how
  crazy the mere thought of existing is. Thirteen point eight billion years
  after a ridiculously huge explosion, a bunch of absolutely tiny particles
  have coalesced somehow into a sentient being that can interact with a various
  bunch of other absolutely tiny particles in ways to create and explore,
  rejoice and suffer, a little mirror, randomly spawned for the universe to
  look at itself. Feynman was always interested in the wonders of the world,
  and he loved a damn good riddle. Look beyond your blinkers (I just had to
  google that, they're those things that limit horses field of vision to
  directly in front of them) and think of things differently than you usually
  do. You find a helluva lotta wonderful curiosities.
* __Fake it till you make it.__ Feynman was hilarious. Many of his best stories
  consisted of him having no idea of what to do but _acting as if he did_, and
  coming out of the situation all the better! In other words, if you're at
  a loss for actions, think a bit and then just do something! You might be
  pleasantly surprised.
* __Always have fun.__ I watched a couple of Feynman videos on Youtube, and he
  always seemed like a jolly guy. Reading the books reinforced that notion. He
  just had fun doing everything! Playing in that Brazilian band, picking locks
  and pranking friends, solving physics problems, solving biology problems,
  talking to girls, visiting Japan, learning to draw; Feynman was always
  enjoying himself. Guess there's no better way to go through life than to have
  fun.
* __There's so much out there; try new things.__ Goes along with the point
  above. Feynman didn't limit himself to specializing in one topic. His
  curiosity and fun-seeking nature led him to explore many different fields.
* __When you learn something, actually understand it, god damn it.__ Kinda goes
  along with a lesson learnt from being a teaching assistant: always, always
  ask questions. Never be content with not understanding something. Challenge
  your own knowledge. Be willing to admit you don't understand something. Be
  willing to put in some damn mental effort to learn something worth it. Think
  of the last time you did that. It was hard, but after you understood it,
  I bet it was a good feeling. Make your knowledge deep.

_Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman_ and _What Do You Care What Other People
Think_ were two of my favorite books in a long, long time. I can't wait to
re-read them and read more of his books!

Was alone a Friday night, so I took Andrew's recommendation and watched _Edge of
Tomorrow_. Given what seemed like a standard science fiction description, my expectations
were low, which meant that I was pleasantly surprised. The film was fun, funny,
action-packed, and even touching at time. The drama of some scenes moments before the
character died was well done. As the film progressed, the watcher began to understand how
many times the protaganist had gone through the endless, hopeless day, and how, slowly,
he had fallen in love with his compatriot. I most enjoyed this portion of the film. The
ending, where all the characters survive and the enemy is defeated, is incredulous of
course, but you can't dock Hollywood too much for being Hollywood.

Following _Zero to One_, I took another one of my coworker's books, _The
Alchemist_, by Paulo Coelho. A short, popular read, it emphasizes again and
again pursuing one's dreams.

The tale is written simply, in the style of a fable. The prose is
uninspiriring. Coelho repeatedly stresses the importance of fulfulling one's
"Personal Legend", asserting that "the universe will conspire" in helping one
attain it.

Some valuable lessons the main character, Santiago, learns include:

* The value of exploration and seeing the world
* You can learn something from anywhere
* The Language of the Soul

Overall, _The Alchemist_ did feel a bit more self-help than literature.

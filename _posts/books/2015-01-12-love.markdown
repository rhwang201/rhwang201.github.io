[To Fall in Love with Anyone, Do This](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/modern-love-to-fall-in-love-with-anyone-do-this.html)
is a popular New York Times article going around the Internet lately. It
resonated with me. I think I agree that you can learn to fall in love with
someone. With enough memories and conversations together, familiarity,
intimacy, trust, and eventually caring will develop. There's the recipe for
love.

Perhaps this section hit me the most:
> Ours was the kind of accelerated intimacy I remembered from summer camp,
> staying up all night with a new friend, exchanging the details of our short
> lives. At 13, away from home for the first time, it felt natural to get to
> know someone quickly. But rarely does adult life present us with such
> circumstances.

I miss really getting to know someone, even if it was through continual,
contrived contact haha. Life moves more slowly dans le version adult; it would
be _weird_ to disrupt that pace, suddenly springing upon someone with
intimate questions. But that slight resistance is there day after day, until
you really crave that intimacy but no longer know where to find it.

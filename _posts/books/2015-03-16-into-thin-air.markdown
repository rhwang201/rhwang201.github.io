_Into Thin Air_ really hit the itching-to-adventure spot. Jon Krakauer recounts
his harrowing tale of disaster during his 1996 Mount Everest journey.
A journalist, Krakaeur writes in an engaging style, with a wide journalist's
vocabulary. He does a great job at painting a clear picture of both the dangers
of high-altitude climbing and the mountaineering spirit. I often found myself
on Everest with him, staring at the Khumbu Icefall or panting, delirious in
a crazed snowstorm, struggling for my life. The story was always engaging, if
not for the thrill then for the novelty of climbing towards the world's roof in
territory not made for man. _Into Thin Air_ is a short read that has definitely
got my adventure crave itching.

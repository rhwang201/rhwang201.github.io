_Norwegian Wood_, a love story written by Haruki Murakami, is the second book the
Brannan/Bluxome book club tackled. I had somewhat heard of _1Q84_ before, so I somehow
developed high expectations for Murakami heading into this novel.

_Norwegian Wood_ is a a simply-written tale, with historical and cultural underpinnings,
that does a decent job in drawing one in emotionally, despite many boring passages. It
felt a bit like a Japanese _Catcher in the Rye_, in that we deal with a troubled young
protaganist struggling to live a "normal" life. _Norwegian Wood_, however, is a bit more
dark, as one of its central themes is death. Watanabe, the protagonist, must face not
only the suicide of his best friend but also the tortured-soul aftermath enveloping his
best friend's girlfriend Naoko, whom he himself falls in love with. While the world
around him begins to rumble with change, Watanabe stays in isolation, interacting only
with a few individuals, as well as in obsession, over the far-off, damaged Naoko.

The storyline was captivating, if not a little vanilla. However, the writing style
I found absolutely boring, at least compared to the other novel I paused to read this.
Sentence structures are very simple (it feels zen! _Japanese_). I ached for some
complexity, but it read in short, simple, understated pieces all the way through. One can
easily empathize with the plot though. We all love reading about hopeless love. We root
for Watanabe, yet we also secretly hope the happy ending does not arrive, for the story
is twinged with too much sadness. Watanabe's oddness adds a bit of excitement to what
otherwise would have been a standard love story.

Overall, though the story did not feel to original and the writing style was a bit too
simplistic for my tastes, the tale had enough oddities and heart-pulls to be enjoyable.

_Cryptonomicon_ was a great Neal Stephenson book to read after _Snow Crash_,
although quite different. Both share the same casual style of humor,
intricate and broad storyline, and exploration of the "hacker" persona, but
whereas _Snow Crash_ is more futuristic and visionary in its plot,
_Cryptonomicon_ contains more pedestrian events.

_Cryptonomicon_ covers two story timelines in parallel, alternating chapters.
When first being introduced to the stories, it can of course be confusing, but
having already read a Stephenson novel, I trusted all would tie together in an
intricate but beautiful way, which of course it did. In one story line, we
follow the hilarious Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse as he aids the Allies in
breaking Axis codes. Some years in the future, Randy Lawrence Waterhouse is
building a company during the 1990s internet boom. The novel has a good range
of characters, each with very distinct personalities, which Stephenson never
fails to hilariously emphasize.

One of my favorite parts (shared with _Snow Crash_) is Stephenson's portrayal
of the highly intelligent. Lawrence, for example, works on intelligence
projects that concern the history of the entire planet, not for power or money,
but simply because he is entralled with the problems he faces. Once he breaks
a code, he is not interesting in the particulars of the messages or reusing his
algorithm. He is satisfied teaching at a (so-so) university and settling down
for a happy simple life. The insanely smart also get lost in their work, Randy
coding and Lawrence breaking codes. I think that's awesome.

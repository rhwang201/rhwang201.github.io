Okay, disclaimer: I'm writing about the movie not the book. But I still have reactions to
_The Martian_. It was pretty damn good.

I think I'm pretty skeptical about most space films. Perhaps because I'm already a bit
more familiar with the cosmos (and technically-inclined) than the average movie-goer, so
I won't be wowed by nice CGI of dramatic rocket scenes and alien star systems. That being
said, _The Martian_ nailed it, as far as space films go. It didn't try to hard. Seems
like it stuck to the book and left all the cheesy Hollywood tricks home.

The plot itself is straightforward, and almost boring for a major film. Matt Damon really
does it, with his sense of human and moments of humanity. A theme vital to me was human
resilience and ingenuity; when faced with a problem, we will find a solution. The film
did a good job of highlighting the difficulties with running a public space corporation
(do we risk the safe crew members' lives? we can't tell them he's actually alive. we need
to think of the public, etc). The difference between Command Center and JPL was well
done. I appreciated that they highlighted the fact that Damon was getting instructions
from crews on Earth. I also appreciated that they showed him emaciated after his long
stay on Mars.

So not the craziest film plotwise, but _The Martian_ explores basic struggles in
spaceflight, with a sense of humor and humanity.

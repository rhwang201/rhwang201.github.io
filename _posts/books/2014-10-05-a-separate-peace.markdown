It's been a while since I've read a "classic" novel, and I am glad I read 
_A Seperate Peace_. It is a tale of two boys struggling with adolescence and
a turbulent world around them, engaged in war. It explores the fall from grace
of what seemed to be a perfect, loving relationship. John Knowles writes with
beautiful prose. Oftentimes, I not only found myself walking the grounds of
Devon, but I also felt the peaceful stillness in the air, the light fading
peacefully over the trees, the exhilaration of being young, and careless, and
free. Knowles had great varying, flowing sentence structure. The moment Finny
died, I knew that was the way it had to happen. His very substance was so
powerful and explosive that his life could only suddenly end.

Overall, this was a pleasant read. Knowles writes in a way that left me feeling
exactly as the Devon boys did: in a tranquil world, with danger and evil in the
air.

I suppose I am going to start using this blog as I think some people use
Pinterest. In other words, this is a nice spot to post style inspirations and
looks I like and appreciate. Hopefully, I will eventually post pics of my own
outfits!

Love the jacket, tie, and shoes. Gives off a nice earthy feel.

Well-fitting navy suit.

I really like the texture of the jacket.

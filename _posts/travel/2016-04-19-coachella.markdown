A return to Indio, CA for Coachella round two. This time, we went Weekend One. I really
enjoyed this trip, compared to the previous one, because I actually had an idea of what
music I liked going in. I did procrastinate a bit in doing my homework; I ended up
blitzing through a song per artist in the days leading up to the festival, but that gave
me a good enough feeling for each artist. Then, I wasn't afraid to branch off from my
group and go see bands I was interested in alone.

# Friday

## Mavis Staples
Black soul-y singer.

## Louis the Child
Cool, but also not my thing, I didn't find it especially interesting.

## Years & Years
Don't really remember this, to be honest.

## Lord Huron
Only saw a bit of them before Foals, but what I expected. Solid chill folk rock.

## Foals
Hell yea. Foals was the performance I was most excited about going into Coachella, and
they did not disappoint. They played a mix of hits and songs I didn't know. I love how
they played some darker, grungier songs. They sounded technically amazing, they all
looked really into it, the lead singer came up to the crowd and he later crowd surfed.
Apparently, they even tried to play over their time (they were in the middle of _killing_
it). They got the plug pulled on them though, but I appreciate them going for it. Awesome
live act.

## The Kills
Aight.

## Borns
Also aight.

## Lido
EDM artist that plays some instruments and stuff. His performance was a story of sorts,
which I thought was cool. Much more artful than other acts I saw. I wasn't super into it,
but I appreciated his originality.

## Sufjan Stevens
Chill guitar.

## Jack U
Lit. So much energy and excitement. Don't think I've ever gone so ape shit haha.

## LCD Soundsystem
Was not planning on seeing him at all going in, but stumbled to his stage with some
friends. His live set was really dancey; I was running all over the place trying to dance
with strangers. Awesome.


# Saturday

## GoGo Penguin
Sweet jazzy trio of piano, bass, keyboard. Digged it, was grooving.

## Vanic
Whatever, just EDM to me.

![Moon Taxi]({{site.url}}/images/travel/coachella2016/moon_taxi.jpg "Moon Taxi")

## Moon Taxi
I liked them! Small crowd and poppy songs, good fun for the early sunny afternoon.

## Strangers You Know
I think these guys were weird as hell. I only liked one of their songs going in (I guess
that was a warning). They were dressed oddly and seemed like they just spent all their
time running around stage trying to hype.

## Gary Clark Jr.
Solid, I wish I saw more of him. It was good blues-y jamming, plenty of guitar riffs.

## James Bay
Overcrowded, but was pretty good live. A little too emotional-mainstream-poppy for me
though?

## Run The Jewels
I MISSED BERNIE SANDERS. Anyway, while rap isn't my thing, I appreciated these guys. Good
rhythm and passion.

## Chvrches
Solid as usual, though I don't get why they never have enough songs to play. Lead
singer's voice is good, other two guys seem a little bored/boring.

## The Arcs
Solid, white rock band. Brought some other white people out, did a good amount of
jamming.

## Unknown Mortal Orchestra
Pleasantly surprised, these guys were awesome! Friends stayed in the back but I went up
into the crowd. African American funk band, got super groovy.

## Ice Cube
Not my thing, but the crowd vibe was fun I guess.

## Zedd
Typical mainstream EDM.

## Guns N Roses
I was exhausted by this time, but it was really cool to see this guys. Slash killed it as
usual, even if I was a little disappointed with Axel.


# Sunday

## Epik High
Lol, nope. Too Korean poppy, definitely not my scene at all. Left early.

## Herbal Something....
Pretty chill at DoLab actually. Good beat, simple.

## The Heavy
Rock.

## Joywave
Dancey, a little eccentric, with a full band actually.

![Wolf Alice]({{site.url}}/images/travel/coachella2016/wolf_alice.jpg "Wolf Alice")

## Wolf Alice
Hard-er rock.

## Hudson Mohawke
Caught a bit, I think I liked him decently?

## Baauer
I did not like Baauer at all. Unconventional beats and transitions left me unable to keep
rhythm.

## Major Lazer
Fun turn-up music.

![Chainsmokers]({{site.url}}/images/travel/coachella2016/chainsmokers.jpg "Chainsmokers")

## The Chainsmokers
I think they played a pretty standard set, but I wasn't super into them. They're in the
"play a bunch of karaoke-able songs with some kind of interested EDM portions in
between" category.

## Flume
Didn't really hear too much, as we were far in the back, but a lot of it sounded too
future-y for me.

## Calvin Harris
Solid stuff, he has tons of hits to play.

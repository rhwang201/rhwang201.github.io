Spent the weekend with a group of friends at Kirk Creek Campgrounds, near the Southern
end of Big Sur. This marked the third weekend in a row that Shin and I had gone camping
(we were a little tired now). We drove down Friday after work. Saturday morning, we had
breakfast and coffee (!), and Deng tried to get pit cooking going. Then, we hiked the
Vicente Flat trail, whose trailhead is right across the street from Kirk Creek. The trail
climbs the large hillside for a while, yielding wonderful views of the Pacific, before
traversing Northward, eventually entering redwoods. We hiked for several hours, enjoying
lunch and the view. Back at camp, Shin and I explored the beach a little bit, then we all
played Catan. We got a fire going as the sun set (which was gorgeous), I picked some
flowers for Shin, and we cooked orzo and chicken over the fire.

My first foray into mountaineering! During an evening of drinks and catching up, Rahul
invited me to join him on a mountaineering trip in mid-May. There was no way I could
refuse.

Rahul and I set out from San Francisco around 0500 on a Friday morning. With no traffic,
we were soon at Yosemite. We took the Tioga Pass, which yielded lovely Yosemite high
country scenes. Once we hit Mono Lake, we turned north up the 395 to stop by Bridgeport
for our wilderness permits, before finally reaching Twin Lakes Resort. There, we parked
our car and set off for the trailhead around 1300.

We followed followed the trail up decent switchbacks, before reach a fork and taking the
trail that follows Horse Creek Trail. The path levelled out, and we walked along some
nice wooded areas along the creek. As we started to gain elevation again, we saw rock and
snow, bare before us. Before we knew it, we had our crampons strapped and ice axes in
hand. We trekked across some flat land, searching for the correct path up the upcoming
ridge. We were supposed to take the right fork of Horse Creek, but with the entire creek
under snow, it was hard to find. Thus, we took the easiest route up, a wide, gently
(enough) sloped bowl. Even that was tough; I hadn't yet learned how much to trust my
crampons, so I had plenty of adrenaline pumping as I pushed myself up that bowl. By the
time we reached the top, it was nearly 1700 (Rahul had difficulties with his crampons all
afternoon), the wind was howling, and the sky was white. We quickly searched for
a camping site and settled on a decently sheltered area. Then, we bunkered down, ate, and
passed out.

We woke up to our alarms at 0400...and we heard the wind still howling. Exercising
prudence, we decided to cancel the summit attempt. We slept in, then headed further up
the ridge to explore anyway. We reached the top of a small hill, where we found
a wonderful campsite and views of Matterhorn Peak and the Incredible Hulk. To see the
peak so close and to realize it was completely out of grasp really hurt. The peak was
beautiful though. We could make out many crampon tracks, as well as skiing tracks (I
should really get into backcountry skiing!). The tracks led up to the left, cresting over
a lip, before reaching the base of the peak. We would've taken East Coulour up and then
scrambled up the South-East side. Alas, clouds and snow were swirling around the peak.
The summit would have to wait for another trip.

After taking in the view for a bit, we headed back down. We glissaded a bit, which was
very fun. I was initially afraid of freaking out and sliding down the entire steep ridge,
but the ice axe was pretty easy to use. Also, walking down hill wasn't as horrible as
I was daydreaming about, although I am still not as confident as I would like. We packed
up camp, headed down the big bowl, and took the quick, easy stroll back down to our car.
Along the way, we stopped and stared back at the mountains, now nearly in complete
white-out conditions, wind and snow howling. We'll be coming back.

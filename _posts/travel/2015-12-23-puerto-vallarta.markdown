Took a quick trip to the beach resort town of Puerto Vallarta for a holiday vacation with
the sister and mother. Our resort was a bit out of town, off a main road. The building
was new, and all facilities were very nice.

I am not really a resort-vacation person, and this trip confirmed that. We ate to our
stomachs' contents (the resort is all-inclusive), relaxed pool/beach-side, had some
drinks,... and that's kind of it. I was going a bit crazy at first but started getting
better once I coded a bit on my laptop. Read a lot (Seveneves). It was a very inactive
vacation. We went downtown once mid-afternoon. There were some stores, and the boardwalk
was somewhat bustling.

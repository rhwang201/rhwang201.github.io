Silas and I decided to tackle Mount Diablo one Saturday morning. I barted over
to East Bay, where Silas picked me up, and we drove over to the park.

By the small parking lot, there is a visitor center, where we picked our trail.
"Summit via Back Creek and Mitchell Canyon" certainly sounded like the most fun
one to me; a 12.4 mile loop with 3,225 feet in elevation gain, this trail is
called "the definitive Mount Diablo hike...[encompassing] all of the park's
life zones, from meadowlands to rock summit". Quite the apt description.

We started off walking through some grassy meadows, before the trail begins to
follow a small, intimate creek. This section is more rocky, with some forest
cover. Then, the ascent began earnestly and brutally. Being in no fit
cardiovascular shape, I was a bit challenged and lagged behind Silas. The climb
was by no means extremely strenuous, but boy I was tired. We passed through
a section with interesting smooth dark-colored trees, before emerging at
a trail crossing, which marked the end of the intense uphill stretch.

Here, the scenery changed drastically. Suddenly, we found ourselves upon
a ridge, open air all around us. We could peer into valleys and gaze upon the
final peak in the distance. This was really the most picturesque portion of the
hike.

After the ridge, the trail winds around the other side of the peak. The hike
then cuts across some steep hills for some fun views. Finally, we arrived at
the summit, which was *cold*. The wind was really blasting up there, to actual
discomfort. We sought refuge in the visitor center, where we found the actual
summit point.

We had some small snacks and began our descent down the other side of the
mountain. This part of the hike was less scenic and exciting than the climb.
Grassy, open hills eventually gave way to dark, wet forest. One part going down
was particularly pretty, descending into a valley. There were many birds in
that area. Once in the valley, the path opened up and we followed a stream
before ending up back at the parking lot.

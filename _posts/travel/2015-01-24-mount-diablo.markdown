Silas and I decided to tackle Mount Diablo one Saturday morning. I barted over
to East Bay, where Silas picked me up, and we drove over to the park.

By the small parking lot, we found a visitor center, where we picked our trail
and grabbed a trail map.  "Summit via Back Creek and Mitchell Canyon" certainly
sounded like the most fun one to me; a 12.4 mile loop with 3,225 feet in
elevation gain, this trail is called "the definitive Mount Diablo
hike...[encompassing] all of the park's life zones, from meadowlands to rock
summit". We found the description to be quite apt.

We started off walking through some grassy meadows, before the trail began to
follow a small, intimate creek. This section was more rocky, with some forest
cover. Then, the ascent began earnestly and brutally. Being in no fit
cardiovascular shape, I was a bit challenged and lagged behind Silas. The climb
was by no means extremely strenuous, but boy I was tired. Even Silas afterwards
admitted he was a bit tired. We passed through a section with interesting
smooth dark-colored trees, before emerging at a trail crossing, which marked
the end of the intense uphill stretch.

Here, the scenery changed drastically. Suddenly, we found ourselves upon
a ridge, open air all around us. We could peer into valleys and gaze upon the
final peak in the distance. This was really the most picturesque portion of the
hike.

After the ridge, the trail wound around the other side of the peak. The hike
then cut across some steep hills, for some fun views straight down the slope
and across nearby towns. Finally, we arrived at the summit, which was *cold*.
The wind was really blasting up there, to moderate discomfort. We sought refuge
in the visitor center, where we found the actual summit point, a small bit of
rock exposed under a sign.

We had some small snacks and began our descent down the other side of the
mountain. This part of the hike was less scenic and exciting than the climb.
Grassy, open hills eventually gave way to dark, wet forest. One part going down
was particularly pretty, descending into a valley. There were many birds in
that area. Once in the valley, the path opened up and we followed a stream
before ending up back at the parking lot.

Overall, Mount Diablo (in particular Back Creek Trail) was a pleasant surprise.
The ascent was challenging, the terrain widely varied and beautiful. Creekside
trails, ridgetop climbing, blisteringly cold winds accompanying panoramic
eagle's point views. Mount Diablo ain't a bad hike.

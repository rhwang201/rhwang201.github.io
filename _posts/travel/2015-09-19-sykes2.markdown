Back to Big Sur, for a very spontaneous backpacking trip with Daniel and Silas. Daniel
was obviously itching to go camping, but he had failed to find a campground through the
week. Saturday morning, I awoke to calls from Daniel. He wanted to go to Big Sur. We
could bike down to Campbell; he had convinced Silas to come! How could I say no to that.
We loaded up the Wee and rode down to meet up with Silas.

We arrived at the trailhead around 1630. There were _plenty_ of spots in the parking lot,
a good sign. We each had a Bud-Light Lime Margherita in the parking lot (they're
terrible) and started the trail. With a lighter pack and perhaps in better shape than
less time, I did not have a tough time with the climbs this time around. We reached the
first campground quickly, then came the familiar ups-and-downs. The sunset was beautiful,
a far off white peak illuminated with warm fiery tones. By the time we reached Barlow
Flats, we had out headlamps out. We descended into Sykes and clambered over rock before
settling at a suitable hammock spot just past the hot springs at 2030. We ate a little
food (my fuel cannister ran out), then hit up the hot springs before calling it a night.

The hike back was hot and face-paced. We jogged much of the down hills. It took Silas
a paltry three hours. We relaxed at the car for a while, before cruising back up the 1,
windows down, ocean breeze running across our faces. We stopped for lovely lunch in
Carmel, then hit the road home.

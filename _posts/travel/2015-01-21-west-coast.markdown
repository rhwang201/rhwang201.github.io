A long awaited West Coast adventure with old friends from back home!

I flew up to Seattle to meet with Jyoti and Nina. There, we did a bunch of
sight-seeing, in addition to embarrassingly highlighting my average alcohol
tolerance. The first night, we stumbled into a popping pizza joint, where the
servers and customers were all singing at the top of their lungs and dancing to
the jubilant party music.

We drove down to frigid Portland, which was a bit quieter as we were there
during the week. We saw most of the sights in Downtown area.

On the drive down to California, we stopped by Devil's Churn and Thor's Well
and were rewarded with a magnificent sunset over the Pacific. Driving by Mt.
Shasta by moonlight was also beautiful.

In SF, we watched fireworks by the bridge, explored the Mission, biked the
Bridge, and hiked Lands End.

I really enjoyed reuniting with old friends. It rejuvenated me.

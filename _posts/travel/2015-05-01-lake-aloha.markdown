A great second backpacking trip, up into Desolation Wilderness. We set out late Friday
night, first meeting up with a second car in Davis. We rolled into South Lake Tahoe
around midnight, and we were able to find a camping spot. The next morning we drove south
past Fallen Leaf Lake and began our hike on the Eastern border of Desolation, at the Glen
Alpine trailhead.

Immediately, we noticed a large amount of runoff. The trail was wet and flooded in many
parts. A waterfall we passed early on was raging.

Overall, the hike was not too strenuous, at something like a thousand feet elevation
gain and six miles. I did have a peristent headache, however, the entire first day,
presumably from the high elevation (ended up ~9000ft). We began in a very green area and
climbed upwards. There were plenty of puddles and streams to cross, from the
aforementioned runoff.

After the first continuous climb, we reached Lake Susie. We found a deep blue lake,
sitting on even ground, surrounded by rocky peaks. We hiked to a nice spot by a waterfall
to have lunch. I ran off, following the stream from the waterfall, and stumbled upon
a cliff, where the stream plunges into a gorgeous valley.

We hiked around the South end of Lake Susie and encountered the first large patch of snow
on the trail. We knew to only expect more as we gained elevation. A brief climb later, we
arrived at Lake Heather. Heather has a couple of islands with trees; they look like they
would be fun to swim to and lounge upon in warmer weather (a member of our group
attempted to swim to an island on the return leg, but the water was too frigid). The
trail around Heather was all shale and loose rock. After Heather, we started climbing
a hill, and that is when the scenery became very desolate. Towering cliffs of shattered
rock replaced the forest and open landscape we were in before. The few trees were
towering, with battered bark and no foliage. We trekked up one more snow covered
incline...

And we arrived at Lake Aloha. It was frigid, the area was blanketed in snow, and the lake
was mostly frozen over, to our surprise. The scene was beautiful. Aloha's small islands
were surrounded by snow-covered ice. Barren rock bordered the lake on our eastern side;
tall snow covered mountains rose across the lake on the western side. It was windy and
_cold_. We set up camp on rock, behind whatever would block the wind for us. We got warm,
I got to use my Platypus Gravityworks for the first time, and for the rest of the day, we
enjoyed each other's company, and the Desolation.

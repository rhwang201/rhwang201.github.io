This was a trip a long time coming. Q, Rosanna, and I went to Galapagos Islands, Ecuador
for our holiday vacation!

![Isabella Beach]({{site.url}}/images/travel/galapagos/iguana_beach.jpg "Isabella Beach")

Getting there was a hassle. We used points for our flights. I went SFO->Houston->Panama
City->Quito. After some small mishaps, we all met up in Quito, where we stayed the
night. The next morning, we flew to Quito before finally flying to Baltra Island,
Galapagos. There, we took a shuttle to a boat, to a shuttle to get to Puerto Ayora,
a (actually, _the_) small port town on the island of Santa Cruz. With many derelict
buildings, it certainly felt third-world. We booked some last minute tours there. We got
okay deals. In the evening, one small street shuts off to vehicles, and the restaurants
fill the pavement with seating. We ate at one of those restaurants and had some fresh
lobster. It was good.

### Dec 29
Two casual tours. The first was a "bay tour". We took a small boat from the dock, where
we saw some blue-footed boobies hanging out on the cliffs. Then we went out of the bay to
visit a small island inhabited by sea lions. We swung west to another bay where we
disembarked and hiked a bit through an arid, desert-like environment to a beach inhabited
by marine iguanas. We went back to look for sharks resting in a calm ravine, but our tour
guide said it was too hot. We did some snorkeling, which freaked me out haha. Took
a little while for me to rememeber how to float. Then we went to another larger ravine
where we jumped off a small pier and explored a bit. In the afternoon, we did the
Highlands tour, which was kind of lame. We expected some hiking. A driver took us to two
volcano craters, then a turtle ranch, with, well, turtles and lava tunnels. Nothing too
crazy or adventurous.

### Dec 30
A day of fun in the water! We went to Santa Fe for a snorkeling trip. We went in the
water in two spots, once on the North side of the island and once in a bay by the beach.
We spotted sharks, turtles, and plenty of fish. The tour guides took the boat fishing
with us in it.  After, we went to a "hidden" beach on the East side of Santa Cruz. There,
we saw sharks and iguanas, and we sun-bathed for a bit.

### Dec 31
Day trip to Isabella today. Boat ride was two hours one day, and it got rough at times.
I took a motion-sickness pill, which helped incredibly. We got on a bus and drove around
a bit. We saw some flamingos, which was kind of lame. We went to
a turtle...conservatory(?), where we saw turtles of all ages. We went to a picturesque
beach. Then, we joined a bay tour, where we saw docile penguins. We did some snorkeling
and happened upon a sleeping sea turtle. We did a quick walk around the volcanic
Tintoreras, where we once again did not catch sleeping sharks. New Year's Eve was
interesting. The town square filled up by the end of the night, there were tons of booths
selling cheap beer and delicious food, cross-dressers harassed traffic for money, and
(apparently) life-size paper mannequins were burned. We drank a decent amount and didn't
last too long into the night.

### Jan 1
This day turned out to be awesome! We took our time getting up, then headed out to
Tortuga Bay, about a one hour walk from our hotel. The first beach was gorgeous,
enormously vast flat white sand. The surf there is too rough, so, as advised, we headed
to the second, smaller, beach. There we laid down, ate, and relaxed for a while, as small
finches investigated us. Then, we rented kayaks, which was incredibly fun. I drifted off
from Rosanna and Kliulai eventually, and ran into tons of animals! Further out, near the
end of the bay, I happened upon several sea turtles, whose only signs of presence were
their occasionally surfacing air-seeking heads. I frantically paddled towards their
position whenever I saw a poking head, but alas I could never see them through the water.
I continued my tour and found a sea lion! It was too agile for me, though, and I lost it.
Then, I came upon all the birds. Somewhere around one hundred blue-footed boobies and
pelicans were resting on rocky outcroppings. I paddled up to the rocks to get close-ups.
As I started to meander back to the beach, I noticed some birds were hunting, to my
delight. It was really captivating to watch them hunt. They would circle, and without
human-visible warning, plunge at neck-breaking speed into the water. I sat enthralled for
a while, until, apparently, it was bird dinner time. Soon, a flock of around one hundred
birds were circling above the bay together. Every now and then, a couple birds would fall
out of formation and plunge into the water when they saw prey. And every now and then,
the entire flock would throw itself at the water, having undoubtedly sighted a large
school of fish. The experience was mesmerizing; the birds didn't give two shits about me.
I chased them all around. Often, birds plunged into the water mere feet away from my
kayak. Eventually, I had to sprint back to the beach to return the kayak. I was excited
for a while.

### Jan 2
Not too much adventure this day. We spent the morning browsing shops; I was looking for
presents for Shin. In the afternoon, we took a boat to San Cristobal. In Baqueriza
Moreno, we had a nice dinner at a cheap, substantial local restaurant.

### Jan 3
Our last day was a good one. We took a boat to the North-Western part of the island. We
did some "warm-up" snorkeling at a beach. There I got to play with a sea lion! I swam in
fluid, quick actions, and it swam around me for a while. We also happened upon some
turtles. Then, we headed to Leon Dormant, or Kicker Rock. This was over some deep ocean.
A lot of girls got tired and didn't stay in the water the entire time. The waves rose and
fell some serious distance. We swam around the rock, spotting Galapagos sharks. We went
back and forth down the channel. There I got to swim within arm's reach of a shark and
a polka-dotted manta ray (not its official name...). We were in search of a hammerhead,
but we couldn't find one. After we got back, they were a little tired, so I went for
a hike.
